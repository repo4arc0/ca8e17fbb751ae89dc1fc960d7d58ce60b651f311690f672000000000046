我知道你在想什么
Now, I know what you're thinking.

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,500
不  托尔被关在笼子里了  怎么回事
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage. How did this happen?"

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,100
有时  你得先被抓住
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,280
才能从某人那里问出个所以然来
just to get a straight answer out of somebody.

19
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,370
说来话长  但其实  我算是个英雄
It's a long story, but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,850
我去地球待了一阵
See, I spent some time on Earth...

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,850
打过几个机器人  救了地球几次
Fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,530
然后我去宇宙中寻找
Then I went searching through the cosmos

23
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,110
几颗有魔法的多彩的无限宝石
for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things.

24
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,560
但没找到
Didn't find any.

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,780
这时我遇到了一条死亡和毁灭之路
That's when I came across a path of death and destruction,

26
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,450
而因此来到了这个笼子里
which led me all the way here into this cage,

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,940
还遇见了你
where I met you.

28
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,050
你觉得我们还要在这里待多久
How much longer do you think we'll be here?

29
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,990
托尔  奥丁之子
Thor, son of Odin.

30
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,710
苏尔特尔  王八之子
Surtur, son of a bitch.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,070
你还活着
You're still alive.

32
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,310
我以为我父亲50万年前杀掉你了
I thought my father killed you like, a half a million years ago.

33
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,080
我不能死
I cannot die.

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,060
我还没有实现命运
Not until I fulfill my destiny

35
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,230
毁灭你的家乡
and lay waste to your home.

36
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,040
正好你提起这个了
You know, it's funny you should mention that.

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,430
因为我最近一直在做噩梦
Because I've been having these terrible dreams of late.

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,870
阿斯加德陷入烈火  成为一片灰烬
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.

39
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,830
而你  苏尔特尔  处于那一切之中
And you, Surtur, are at the center of all of them.

40
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,070
那你已经见识到了诸神黄昏  阿斯加德的陨落
Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard.

41
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,260
-伟大的预言  -等等
- The great prophecy... - Hang on.

42
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:30,960
等等
Hang on.

43
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,480
我马上就能转回去
I'll be back around shortly.

44
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,920
我真觉得我们刚刚聊得很投机
I really feel like we were connecting there.

45
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,620
好了  诸神黄昏  跟我讲讲  仔细说说
Okay, so Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it.

46
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,520
我的时代到来了
My time has come.

47
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,140
等我的王冠再次沐浴永恒烈火
When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame,

48
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,860
我就将恢复全部力量
I shall be restored to my full might.

49
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,180
比山还高
I will tower over the mountains,

50
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,100
把剑深深插入阿斯加德的...
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...

51
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,210
等等  等一下
Hang on. Give it a second.

52
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,580
我发誓  我根本没动  是它自己在转
I swear, I'm not even moving. It's just doing this on its own.

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,370
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,830
好了  是这么回事吗
Okay, so let me get this straight.

55
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,180
你要把你的王冠放进永恒烈火里
You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame

56
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,610
然后你会突然变得有房子那么大
and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house?

57
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,670
是山
A mountain!

58
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,130
永恒烈火是奥丁锁在阿斯加德的那个
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?

59
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,970
奥丁不在阿斯加德
Odin is not on Asgard.

60
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,620
而你的离开让王权失去了防卫
And your absence has left the throne defenseless.

61
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,980
好吧  那王冠在哪呢
Okay, so where is it? This crown?

62
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,410
这就是我的王冠  我力量的源泉
This is my crown, the source of my power.

63
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,860
那是王冠啊  我以为你是眉毛长得比较夸张
Oh, that's a crown. I thought it was a big eyebrow.

64
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,010
是王冠
It's a crown.

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,640
总之  听上去  我想阻止诸神黄昏
Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok

66
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,690
只需要扯下你脑袋上那玩意
is rip that thing off your head.

67
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,490
但诸神黄昏已经开始了
But Ragnarok has already begun.

68
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,990
你无法阻止
You cannot stop it.

69
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,340
我是阿斯加德的末日  你也是
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.

70
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,380
一切都将遭受煎熬  被烈火吞噬
All will suffer, all will burn.

71
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,630
好紧张
That's intense.

72
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,140
老实说  看着你变得老大
To be honest, seeing you grow really big

73
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,910
然后烧掉一颗星球  肯定很壮观
and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.

74
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,700
但看来我只能选择第二条路
But it looks like I'm gonna have to choose option B,

75
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,390
那就是我挣脱这铁链
where I bust out of these chains,

76
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,200
把你的头饰从脑袋上砸下来
knock that tiara off your head,

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,470
然后藏在阿斯加德的地堡里
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.

78
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,630
你无法阻止诸神黄昏
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

79
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,000
何必抵抗呢
Why fight it?

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,770
因为  英雄都会这么做
Because that's what heroes do.

81
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,790
等等  抱歉  我时机掐得不太好
Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't time that right.

82
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,260
来了
And, now!

83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,640
{\an9}BGM: Immigrant Song  By  Led Zeppelin

84
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,280
你犯了个大错误  奥丁森
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.

85
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,890
我经常犯大错误
I make grave mistakes all the time.

86
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,390
看来结果还不错嘛
Everything seems to work out.

87
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,760
海姆达尔  我知道我们好久没联系了
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,

88
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,520
但我真的很需要赶紧离开这里
but I could really use a fast exit.

89
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,250
海姆达尔
Heimdall?

90
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,660
海姆达尔就是个蠢货
Heimdall was an idiot.

91
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,830
这份工作本该让他发财的
This job should have made him rich.

92
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,230
这份工作并不轻松
Now, the job ain't easy

93
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,500
但还是有些好处的
but it does have its benefits.

94
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,070
彩虹桥让我可以接触到
The Bifrost gives me access

95
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,750
九大王国的一切
to everything the Nine Realms has to offer.

96
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,170
我想拿就拿
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.

97
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,870
看啊
Behold...

98
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,280
我的东西
My stuff.

99
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,100
我特别喜欢这俩玩意
I'm particularly fond of these.

100
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,840
我从米德加德一个叫德克萨斯的地方拿到了它们
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard called Texas.

101
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,430
我还给它们起了名字  毁天和灭地
I even named them. Des and Troy.

102
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,330
因为  当它们合在一起
You see, when you put them together,

103
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,660
就能毁天灭地
they destroy.

104
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,500
海姆达尔  拜托了
Heimdall, come on.

105
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,390
别动
Stay!

106
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,460
海姆达尔  我要没招了
Heimdall? I'm running short on options.

107
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,970
海姆达尔
Heimdall?

108
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,930
斯科尔奇
Skurge?

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,470
那个要紧吗
Is that important?

110
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,490
你们俩姑娘今天有好戏看了
You girls are in for a treat.

111
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,140
姑娘们
Girls!

112
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,110
哎呦呦
Well, well, well.

113
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,690
看看是谁决定回来了
Look who decided to pop in.

114
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,110
感谢你吓跑了我的女伴
Thanks for scaring away my company

115
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,130
还弄得我的办公场所全是脑浆
and drenching my workplace in brains.

116
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:06,920
你是谁
Who are you?

117
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,240
你不记得了吗  斯科尔奇
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.

118
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,690
我们曾在华纳海姆并肩作战
We fought together on Vanaheim.

119
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,560
想起来了
Right.

120
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,320
海姆达尔呢
Where is Heimdall?

121
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,410
那个叛徒  没人知道  他是王室逃犯
That traitor. Well, no one knows. He's a fugitive of the throne.

122
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,460
叛徒
Traitor?

123
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,780
对  奥丁指控海姆达尔玩忽职守
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty

124
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,860
但他在审判前就消失不见了
but he disappeared before the trial.

125
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,300
想抓住一个能洞察宇宙中一切的人可不容易
Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the universe.

126
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,430
-是啊  -等等
- Sure. - Hold on. Hold on.

127
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,430
我要宣告你的到来的
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.

128
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,510
这是什么玩意
What the hell is that?

129
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,100
哥哥  时候到了
Oh, brother. This is it.

130
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,270
我要离世了
I take my leave.

131
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,880
你真傻  怎么不听我的
You fool, you didn't listen!

132
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,910
对不起
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,160
希芙女士  去找人帮忙
Lady Sif, get help!

134
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,740
谁来帮帮忙啊
Somebody, help!

135
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,390
我为我做的一切道歉
I'm sorry for all I've done.

136
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,670
没事的  撑住
It's all right. Hold on.

137
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,120
抱歉我企图统治地球
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

138
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,700
有你只会是他们的幸运
They'd be lucky to have you.

139
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,790
宇宙魔方的事我也很抱歉
I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.

140
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,650
-我就是忍不住  -我知道
- I just couldn't help myself. - I know.

141
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,810
-我喜欢耍诡计  -是啊
- I'm a trickster. - Yes.

142
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,300
总爱搞恶作剧
So mischievous.

143
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,870
抱歉我那次把你变成了只青蛙
Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.

144
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,390
那是很有趣的笑话
It was a wonderful joke.

145
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,550
的确是非常好笑
'Twas indeed hilarious.

146
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,210
你是阿斯加德的拯救者
You are the savior of Asgard.

147
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,920
-讲述我的故事  -我会的
- Tell my story. - I will.

148
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,720
为我建一座雕像
Build a statue for me.

149
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,340
我们会为你建一座大雕像的
We will build a big statue for you.

150
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,180
还要戴着我的头盔  有大弯角的那个
With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns.

151
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,570
你的英勇我会禀告父王
I will tell Father what you did here today.

152
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,210
我不是为了他
I didn't do it for him.

153
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,970
我不是为了他
I didn't do it for him.

154
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,520
不
No!

155
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,510
洛基因伤不治而死
And so, Loki died of his wounds,

156
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,810
他为我们献出了生命
giving his life for ours.

157
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,290
他击退了那些可憎的精灵
He fought back those disgusting elves,

158
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,320
为王国带来了和平
he brought peace to the realm.

159
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,930
洛基  我的儿子
Loki, my boy...

160
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,840
多年前  我在那覆满冰霜的战场上发现了你
'Twas many moons ago I found you on that frostbitten battlefield.

161
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,840
那天  我尚未看出你是
On that day, I did not yet see in you

162
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,900
阿斯加德的拯救者  是啊
Asgard's savior. No.

163
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,940
你只是个小蓝冰棍
You were merely a little blue baby icicle

164
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,680
却融化了我这老傻瓜的心
that melted this old fool's heart.

165
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,740
精彩  精彩  演得好
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.

166
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,170
父亲
Father.

167
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,440
该死
Shit.

168
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,460
我的儿子  托尔回来了
My son, Thor, has returned!

169
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,060
你好  我的孩子
Greetings, my boy.

170
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,370
这出戏真有趣  叫什么
It's an interesting play. What's it called?

171
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,410
《阿斯加德的洛基之惨剧》
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.

172
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,680
人民想纪念他
The people wanted to commemorate him.

173
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,890
他们是该如此
Indeed they should.

174
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,220
我喜欢那座雕像
I like the statue.

175
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,450
比他在世时要好看多了
A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though.

176
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,280
不那么猥琐  油腻了
A little less weaselly, less greasy, maybe.

177
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,250
你知道这是什么吗
Do you know what this is?

178
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,810
苏尔特尔的头骨  厉害的武器啊
The skull of Surtur. That's a formidable weapon!

179
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,520
帮个忙  把这个锁进地堡
Do me a favor. Lock this away in a vault

180
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,170
免得它变成巨大的怪物
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster

181
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,750
毁了整个星球
and destroy the whole planet.

182
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,230
谢谢  亲爱的
Thank you, dear.

183
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,020
那么你要回米德加德了吗
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?

184
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,700
不
Nope.

185
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,200
我最近老做同一个梦
I've been having this reoccurring dream lately.

186
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,980
每晚上  我都看到阿斯加德化为灰烬
Every night, I see Asgard fall into ruins.

187
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,910
不过是个没意义的梦
That's just a silly dream,

188
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,090
说明你的想象力太丰富了
signs of an overactive imagination.

189
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,060
或许吧
Possibly.

190
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,160
但我决定出去勘察一番
But then I decide to go out there and investigate.

191
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,340
结果发现  九大王国一片混乱
And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.

192
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,560
阿斯加德的敌人集结起来  阴谋致我们于死地
Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise,

193
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,580
而你  奥丁  九大王国的保护者
all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms,

194
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,520
却穿着浴袍坐在这里  吃着葡萄
are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes.

195
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,840
是啊  我们最好尊重邻居的自由
Yes, it is best to respect our neighbors' freedom.

196
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,030
是啊  被屠杀的自由
Yes, of course, the freedom to be massacred.

197
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,880
是啊  而且  我一直忙着呢
Yes, besides I've been rather busy myself.

198
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,770
看剧
Watching theater.

199
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,260
委员会会议  安全理事会会议
Well, board meetings, and security council meetings...

200
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,400
-你真要逼我这么做吗  -做什么
- You're really gonna make me do it? - Do what?

201
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,340
你很清楚什么都无法阻止雷神之锤回到我手上
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.

202
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,740
哪怕是你的脸
Not even your face.

203
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,580
你发疯了吧  你会被因此处死的
You've gone quite mad. You'll be executed for this.

204
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,130
那我们就可以在另一边相见了  弟弟
Then I'll see you on the other side, brother.

205
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,610
好吧  我投降
All right, I yield.

206
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,630
看啊
Behold!

207
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,680
托尔
Thor...

208
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,240
-奥丁森  -不
- Odinson. - No.

209
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,320
你就一份工作  就这一份
You had one job. Just the one.

210
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,030
奥丁在哪
Where's Odin?

211
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,740
你就不能别回来吗
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

212
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,280
没有你一切都好好的
Everything was fine without you.

213
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,090
阿斯加德繁荣昌盛  都叫你毁了
Asgard was prospering. You've ruined everything.

214
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,320
-问问他们  -父亲在哪  你杀了他吗
- Ask them. - Where's Father? Did you kill him?

215
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,800
你得到你想要的了  你得到你要的独立了
You had what you wanted. You had the independence you asked for.

216
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,960
好吧  我很清楚他在哪
Okay. I know exactly where he is.

217
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,550
我发誓我就是把他留在这儿的
I swear I left him right here.

218
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,980
是在人行道上
Right here on the sidewalk,

219
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,000
还是在那栋正被拆除的建筑里
or right there where the building is being demolished?

220
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,820
计划得真好
Great planning.

221
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,930
我怎么会知道
How was I supposed to know?

222
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,590
我又不能看到未来  我不是巫师
Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.

223
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,740
是吗  那你为什么穿得像个巫师
No? Then why do you dress like one?

224
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,000
真不敢相信你还活着
I can't believe you're alive.

225
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,430
我看到你死了  我为你哀悼  为你哭泣
I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you.

226
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,550
我好荣幸
I'm honored.

227
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,760
去问他
Ask him.

228
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,130
你可以跟我们合个影吗
Would you mind taking a picture with us?

229
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,810
当然
Sure.

230
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,980
快想想他在哪
Start figuring out where he is.

231
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,560
天呐
Oh, my God.

232
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,080
很遗憾简甩了你
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

233
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,660
她才没甩我
She didn't dump me, you know.

234
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,480
是我甩了她  我们彼此互甩的
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.

235
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,460
怎么回事  你在做什么
What's this? What are you doing?

236
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,500
这不是我做的
This isn't me.

237
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,650
洛基
Loki.

238
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,500
托尔·奥丁森
Thor Odinson.

239
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,510
雷神
God of Thunder.

240
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,920
你可以把伞放下了
You can put down the umbrella.

241
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,570
地球上现在还有男巫了
So, Earth has wizards now?

242
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,700
我们更喜欢被称为"魔法师"
The preferred term is "Master of the Mystic Arts."

243
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,940
别管了
You can leave that now.

244
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,870
好吧  男巫  你是谁  我为什么要在乎
All right, wizard. Who are you? Why should I care?

245
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,880
我是斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,

246
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,790
我有些问题要问你
and I have some questions for you.

247
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,470
请坐
Take a seat.

248
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,060
喝茶吗
Tea?

249
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,070
我不喝茶
I don't drink tea.

250
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,470
你喝什么
What do you drink?

251
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,520
不喝茶
Not tea.

252
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,700
我有一份关注名单
So, I keep a watch list

253
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,330
都是来自其他世界
of individuals and beings from

254
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,700
可能对这个世界构成威胁的人
other realms that may be a threat to this world.

255
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,410
你的领养弟弟  洛基  就是其中之一
Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.

256
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,100
的确该加上他
He's a worthy inclusion.

257
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,820
为什么带他来这儿
Then why bring him here?

258
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,240
我们在找我父亲
We're looking for my father.

259
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,920
那么  如果我告诉你奥丁在哪
So, if I were to tell you where Odin was,

260
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,580
所有相关人士都会马上回阿斯加德吗
all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard?

261
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,590
是的  马上
Promptly.

262
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,490
太好了  我来帮你吧
Great! Then I'll help you.

263
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,010
如果你知道他在哪  为什么不联系我
If you knew where he was, why didn't you call me?

264
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,690
我得告诉你  他坚持不许人打搅他
I have to tell you, he was adamant that he not be disturbed.

265
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,620
你父亲说他选择继续被流放
Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile.

266
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,990
而且你没有电话
And you don't have a phone.

267
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,110
是啊  我没有电话
No, I don't have a phone,

268
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,140
但你可以发个
but you could have sent

269
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,000
电子信件  叫电邮
an electronic letter. It's called an email.

270
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,380
-嗯  你有电脑吗  -没有  干吗用
- Yeah, do you have a computer? - No. What for?

271
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,000
总之  我父亲不再被流放了
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.

272
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,920
麻烦你告诉我他在哪  我就能带他回家了
So if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home.

273
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,060
没问题  他在挪威
Gladly. He's in Norway.

274
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,060
我就是查看一下
I'm just seeing

275
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,490
这则咒语是否要为阿斯加德人做些调整
whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications.

276
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,790
不用
Nope.

277
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,110
我们不需要那个
We don't need that.

278
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,960
你能不能别那么做了
Will you stop doing that?

279
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,310
我可以...我需要你一根头发
Can I... I need just one strand of your hair.

280
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,340
我告诉你  我的头发是碰不得的
Let me explain something. My hair is not to be meddled with.

281
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,100
我们完全可以用走的
We could have just walked.

282
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,180
他在等你了
He's waiting for you.

283
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,680
好
All right.

284
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,850
别忘了你的伞
Don't forget your umbrella.

285
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,630
是啊
Yes.

286
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,900
抱歉
Sorry.

287
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,590
来了
There we go.

288
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,850
我还得要回我弟弟
I suppose I'll need my brother back.

289
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,690
对了  好的
Yeah. Right.

290
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,030
我都下落30分钟了
I have been falling for 30 minutes!

291
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,170
他就交给你了
You can handle him from here.

292
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,270
好的  非常感谢你帮忙
Yes. Of course. Thank you very much for your help.

293
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,950
祝你好运
Good luck.

294
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,040
"交给你"  你是谁
Handle me? Who are you?

295
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,940
洛基
Loki.

296
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,530
你是什么术士吗
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?

297
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,050
你个二流货  别以为你...
Don't think for one minute, you second-rate...

298
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,300
好吧  再见
All right. Bye-bye.

299
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,570
父亲
Father?

300
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,950
看看这里  多美
Look at this place. It's beautiful.

301
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,640
父亲  是我们
Father, it's us.

302
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,530
我的儿子们
My sons.

303
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,420
我一直在等你们
I've been waiting for you.

304
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,340
我知道  我们来接你回家了
I know. We've come to take you home.

305
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,130
回家  是啊
Home, yes.

306
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,370
你们母亲  她在召唤我
Your mother, she calls me.

307
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,750
你们听到了吗
Do you hear it?

308
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,050
洛基  解除你的魔法
Loki, lift your magic.

309
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,140
我花了好久才摆脱你的咒语
Took me quite a while to break free from your spell.

310
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,140
弗丽嘉会为你自豪的
Frigga would have been proud.

311
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,460
过来陪我坐下  我没多少时间了
Come and sit with me. I don't have much time.

312
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,040
我知道我们辜负了你
I know we failed you.

313
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,610
但我们可以弥补的
But we can make this right.

314
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,400
是我辜负了你们
I failed you.

315
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,410
诸神黄昏已经到来
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

316
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,330
不  我阻止了诸神黄昏  我了结了苏尔特尔
No, I've stopped Ragnarok. I put an end to Surtur.

317
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,630
不
No.

318
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,260
已经开始了  她要来了
It has already begun. She's coming.

319
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,520
我的生命是唯一遏制着她的东西
My life was all that held her back.

320
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,440
但我大限将至
But my time has come.

321
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,820
我无法再抵住她了
I cannot keep her away any longer.

322
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,670
父亲  你在说谁
Father, who are you talking about?

323
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,100
死亡女神  海拉
Goddess of Death. Hela.

324
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,360
我的长女
My firstborn.

325
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,960
你姐姐
Your sister.

326
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,130
什么
Your what?

327
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,250
她的暴力欲望膨胀到我无法控制
Her violent appetites grew beyond my control.

328
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,700
我无法阻止她  就囚禁了她  把她关了起来
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her. Locked her away.

329
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,160
她从阿斯加德汲取力量
She draws her strength from Asgard,

330
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,070
等她到了那里  她的力量就将无可限量
and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless.

331
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,510
不管她是什么  我们可以一同阻止她
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.

332
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,060
我们可以一同对抗她
We can face her together.

333
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,070
不行的
No, we won't.

334
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,530
我已走上了另一条路
I'm on a different path now.

335
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,780
这件事你们得独自面对了
This you must face alone.

336
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,860
我爱你们  我的儿子
I love you, my sons.

337
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,260
看啊
Look at that.

338
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,410
记住这地方
Remember this place.

339
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,900
家园
Home.

340
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,160
哥哥
Brother.

341
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,750
这都怪你
This was your doing.

342
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,550
他死了啊
So he's gone.

343
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,530
真可惜  我还挺想看到那一幕的
That's a shame. I would've liked to have seen that.

344
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,640
你就是海拉吧
You must be Hela.

345
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,130
我是托尔  奥丁之子
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

346
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,390
是吗  你长得不像他
Really? You don't look like him.

347
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,530
或许我们可以商量一下
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.

348
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,390
你口气像他
You sound like him.

349
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,600
跪下
Kneel.

350
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,080
你说什么
Beg your pardon?

351
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,720
跪下
Kneel.

352
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,860
拜见你的女王
Before your queen.

353
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,490
别指望了
I don't think so.

354
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,220
不可能
It's not possible.

355
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,370
亲爱的  你根本想象不到我都能做什么
Darling, you have no idea what's possible.

356
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,700
带我们回去
Bring us back!

357
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,520
不
No!

358
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,880
洛基
Loki!

359
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,940
你是谁  你把托尔怎么了
Who are you? What have you done with Thor?

360
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,970
我是海拉
I'm Hela.

361
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,490
我就是个扫地的
I'm just a janitor.

362
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,100
你看上去像个求生本能强烈的机灵鬼
You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.

363
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,110
想要份工作吗
How would you like a job?

364
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,820
你是个战士吗
Are you a fighter?

365
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,060
还是食物
Or are you food?

366
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,350
我就是路过
I'm just passing through.

367
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,470
是食物
It is food.

368
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,770
跪下
On your knees.

369
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,560
他是我的
He's mine.

370
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,110
等等
Wait!

371
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,060
等等
Wait!

372
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,670
他是我的
He's mine.

373
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,130
如果你们想要他  得过我这关
So if you want him, you go through me.

374
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,960
但我们已经得到他了
But we've already got him.

375
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,320
那好吧  我就先过你们这关
All right, then. I guess I go through you.

376
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,900
又来食物了
More food.

377
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:12,900
谢谢
Thank you.

378
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,480
拾荒者142号  我需要进门并觐见老大
Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss.

379
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,810
我带来了特别的东西
I've got something special.

380
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,330
你要带我去哪
Where are you taking me?

381
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,370
回答我
Answer me!

382
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,190
我是托尔  奥丁之子  我得回阿斯加德
I am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard.

383
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,400
非常抱歉  王子殿下
Many apologies, your majesty.

384
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,480
我发现  你们并不认识我
It's come to my attention that you don't know who I am.

385
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,580
我是海拉  奥丁的长女
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,

386
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,310
阿斯加德大军的统帅
the commander of the Legions of Asgard,

387
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,910
王位的合法继承人  死亡女神
the rightful heir to the throne, and the Goddess of Death.

388
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,230
我父亲已死
My father is dead.

389
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,730
两位王子也是  不客气
As are the princes. You're welcome.

390
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:09,040
我们曾在宇宙中坐拥无上力量
We were once the seat of absolute power in the cosmos.

391
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,220
我们的地位无可匹及
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

392
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,610
但奥丁却止步于九大王国
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

393
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,500
我们的命运是统治所有其他王国
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

394
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,440
我是来恢复那份权势的
And I am here to restore that power.

395
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,160
给我跪下
Kneel before me

396
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,170
加入我  与我一起踏上伟大的征途
and rise into the ranks of my great conquest.

397
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,350
不管你是谁
Whoever you are,

398
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,900
不管你做了什么  马上投降
whatever you've done, surrender now!

399
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,060
否则我们绝不留情
Or we will show you no mercy.

400
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,340
不管我是谁  我刚刚说话你听没听啊
Whoever I am? Did you listen to a word I said?

401
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,600
这是你最后的警告
This is your last warning!

402
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,030
我以为你们会乐意见到我呢
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

403
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,560
好吧
Fine.

404
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,580
进攻
Charge!

405
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,940
我真怀念这个
I've missed this.

406
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,960
不过  真是可惜
Still, it's a shame.

407
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,680
好战士白白枉死
Good soldiers dying for nothing,

408
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,940
就因为他们看不到未来
all because they couldn't see the future.

409
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,570
悲哀
Sad.

410
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,760
看  他还活着
Look, still alive.

411
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:27,780
改主意了吗
Change of heart?

412
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,470
滚回你爬出来的山洞去吧
Go back to whatever cave you crept out of.

413
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,850
你个女魔头
You evil demoness!

414
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,610
去看看我的王宫吧
Let's go see my palace.

415
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,420
别担心  你已被找到
Fear not, for you are found.

416
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,250
你到家了  再也回不去了
You are home, and there is no going back.

417
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,300
没人能离开此地
No one leaves this place.

418
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,250
但这里是什么地方
But what is this place?

419
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,470
这里是  萨卡
The answer is Sakaar.

420
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,530
被宇宙传送门环绕
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,

421
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,620
萨卡位于已知和未知世界的边缘
Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown.

422
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,460
这里收集了所有迷失  不被爱的东西
It is the collection point for all lost and unloved things.

423
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,780
比如你
Like you.

424
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,100
但在萨卡  你是重要的
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.

425
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,430
你是有价值的
You are valuable.

426
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,470
你是被爱的
Here you are loved.

427
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,550
怎么回事
What the hell?

428
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,330
没人比宗师更爱你了
And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.

429
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,070
他是最初的  第一个迷失  第一个被找到的人
He is the original, the first lost and the first found.

430
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,720
萨卡的创始人
The creator of Sakaar,

431
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,160
冠军格斗之父
and father of the Contest of Champions.

432
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,580
虽然你曾经一文不名  但现在你有了身份
Where once you were nothing, now you are something.

433
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,830
你是宗师的财产
You are the property of the Grandmaster.

434
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,190
恭喜
Congratulations!

435
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,540
你将在5秒后见到宗师
You will meet the Grandmaster in five seconds.

436
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,480
准备好
Prepare yourself.

437
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,630
准备好
Prepare yourself.

438
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,530
你将见到宗师
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.

439
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,620
他真棒  是个"他"吧
He's wonderful. It is a he?

440
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,980
是的
It is a he.

441
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,160
嗯
Yeah.

442
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,520
我就喜欢你过来  142
I love when you come to visit, 142.

443
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,360
你总给我带最好的东西来
You bring me the best stuff.

444
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,060
托佩兹  每次我们聊起拾荒者142号
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142,

445
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,820
我都怎么说  "她是..."  B开头的词
what do I always say? "She is the..." And it starts with a "B."

446
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,850
垃圾
Trash.

447
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,790
不  不是垃圾
No, not trash.

448
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,910
你是就等着那么说她吗
Were you waiting just to call her that?

449
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,350
都不是B开头的词
It doesn't start with a "B."

450
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,710
酒鬼婆娘
Booze hag.

451
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,650
抱歉  不是  "最好的"
I'm so sorry. No, "Best."

452
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,070
我是想说"最好的"
I was thinking about "Best."

453
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,400
因为我总说你是最好的
'Cause I always say you're the best.

454
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,310
她为我带来了我的格斗冠军呢
She brought me my beloved champion, you know.

455
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,290
每次她来你都这么说
You say that every time she's here.

456
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,980
你今天带来的是什么  告诉我
What have you brought today? Tell me.

457
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,170
参赛者
A contender.

458
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,020

459

我得凑近点  我要凑近看看他
I need to go closer. I want to get a closer look at this.

460
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,430
可以把我往前推推吗  谢谢
Can you take us closer? Thank you.

461
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,110
给她钱
Pay this lady.

462
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,230
给我等一下
Just wait a damn minute.

463
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,670
我可不是卖品
I'm not for sale.

464
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,560
天呐  他挺有斗志
Man, he's a fighter.

465
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,840
我要一千万
I take 10 million.

466
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,120
告诉她那是做梦
Tell her she's dreaming.

467
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,540
老天  给她钱吧
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.

468
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,070
你会付出代价的
You'll pay for this.

469
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,890
不  是别人付我钱
No, I got paid for this.

470
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,910
我想知道的是
Here's what I wanna know.

471
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,460
你是谁
Who are you?

472
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:11,770
我是雷神
I am the God of Thunder.

473
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,950
我没听到雷声
I didn't hear any thunder,

474
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,820
但你手上的是电火花吗
but out of your fingers, was that sparkles?

475
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,730
我们找到你表亲了
We've located your cousin.

476
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:21,850
太好了
Good!

477
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,230
来吧  你会喜欢这个的
Yeah, come on. I think you're gonna like this.

478
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,290
他在这儿呢
There he is.

479
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,510
表弟
Hey, cuz.

480
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,710
我们差点没找到你  你藏起来了吗
We almost couldn't find you. What, you been hiding?

481
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:32,950
那么
So...

482
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,800

484
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,000
嗯

485
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,540
卡洛

00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,430
救命
Help me.

492
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,690
天呐
Oh, my God!

493
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,090
流到我脚下了  看啊
I'm stepping in it. I'm stepping in it. Look!

494
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,990
好臭
The smell.

495
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,480
这是什么味儿
What does it smell like?

496
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,720
烤焦的吐司
Burnt toast.

497
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,340
我怎么这么没礼貌
What happened to my manners?

498
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,640
我还没好好自我介绍呢
I haven't properly introduced myself.

499
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,660
来吧  跟我来
Come on. Follow me.

500
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,500
我叫宗师
My name is Grandmaster.

501
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,020
我主持一项
I preside over a little

502
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,720
滑稽表演  叫做冠军格斗
harlequinade called the Contest of Champions.

503
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,660
来自各处的人  都会不情愿地参与其中
People come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it.

504
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,530
而你  我的朋友  可以加入新卡司
And you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast.

505
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,470
怎么样
What do you say to that?

506
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,710
我们不是朋友  我也不在乎你的游戏
We're not friends and I don't give a shit about your games.

507
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,460
我要回阿斯加德
I'm going back to Asgard.

508
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,680
阿屎加德
Ass-gard.

509
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,310
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four.

510
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,120
我下方有个时间空间的虫洞
There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me.

511
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,130
于是  我放手了
At that moment, I let go.

512
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,250
洛基
Loki?

513
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,560
洛基
Loki! Loki!

514
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,800
过来
Over here. Over here.

515
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,880
-失陪一下  -洛基
- Excuse me one second. - Loki!

516
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,760
-干什么  -你还活着

517
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,790
-我当然还活着  -你怎么来了
- Yes, of course I'm alive. - What are you doing here?

518
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,460
这话什么意思
What do you mean, what am I doing?

519
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,040
我被困在这张破椅子上了
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

520
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,570
-你怎么没坐椅子  -没人让我坐椅子
- Where's your chair? - I didn't get a chair.

521
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,890
-帮我从这椅子上起来  -不行
- Get me out of this one. - I can't.

522
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,020
-帮我起来  -不行
- Get me out. - I can't.

523
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,710
什么
What?

524
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,300
我跟那个宗师交了朋友
I've made friends with this man. He's called the Grandmaster.

525
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,230
-他是个疯子  -我赢得了他的好感
- He's crazy! - I've gained his favor.

526
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,850
彩虹桥几周前把我丢到了这里
The Bifrost brought me out here weeks ago.

527
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,980
-几周前  -是啊
- Weeks ago? - Yes.

528
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,150
我才刚到
I just got here.

529
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,450
你们在小声说什么呢
What are you whispering about?

530
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,440
这里的时间规律很不一样
Time works real different around these parts.

531
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,560
在别的世界上  我都该几百万岁了
On any other world, I'd be, like, millions of years old.

532
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,710
但在萨卡上
But here on Sakaar...

533
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:29,610
不管怎样  你认识这个...
In any case, you know this...

534
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,920
你称自己为雷王是吧
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?

535
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,390
雷神  告诉他
God of Thunder. Tell him.

536
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,380
我这辈子从未见过这个人
I've never met this man in my life.

537
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,060
-他是我弟弟  -领养的
- He's my brother. - Adopted.

538
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,430
他能不能打
Is he any kind of a fighter?

539
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,380
你把我脖子上的东西拿走  我就打给你看看
You take this thing out of my neck and I'll show you.

540
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,460
瞧瞧  他在威胁我呢
Now, listen to that. He's threatening me.

541
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,330
小火花  事情是这样的
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

542
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,910
如果你想回到那个二死堡还是什么的地方
If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg...

543
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,930
阿斯加德
Asgard.

544
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,130
任何参赛者  只要能打败我的冠军
Any contender who defeats my champion,

545
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,340
就能赢得自由
their freedom they shall win.

546
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,790
好啊  那就给我指个路
Fine. Then point me in the direction

547
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,530
要我去揍的人在哪里
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

548
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,250
这才是我的参赛者
That's what I call, contender.

549
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,850
这边走  大王
Direction would be this way, Lord.

550
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,530
洛基
Loki!

551
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,620
放松点  哥们
Take it easy, man.

552
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,770
这边呢
Over here.

553
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,900
向你招手的一堆石头
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.

554
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,220
是的  我其实是有生命的
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.

555
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,530
请允许我做个自我介绍
Allow me to introduce myself.

556
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,990
我叫寇格  我算是这里的领导吧
My name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here.

557
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,690
你也能看出来  我是石头做的
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.

558
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,560
但不要被我的外表吓到
But don't let that intimidate you.

559
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,140
你不用害怕  除非你是剪刀做的
You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors.

560
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,830
就是跟你开个石头剪刀布的小玩笑
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you.

561
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,010
这是我的好朋友  米克
This is my very good friend over here, Miek.

562
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,520
他是只有剪刀手的昆虫
He's an insect and has knives for hands.

563
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,910
你是克努南人  对吗
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

564
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,280
-没错  -你怎么会落到这里
- That I am. - How'd you end up in here?

565
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,610
我试图发动革命来着
Well, I tried to start a revolution,

566
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,150
但没做好宣传工作
but didn't print enough pamphlets.

567
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,780
所以几乎没人参加
So hardly anyone turned up,

568
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,110
除了我妈妈和她那讨厌的男朋友
except for my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.

569
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,730
作为惩罚  我被迫来到这里做个角斗士
As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator.

570
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,740
简直是个宣传灾难
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

571
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,720
但我其实在策划另一场革命
But I'm actually organizing another revolution.

572
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,780
我不知道你是不是感兴趣
I don't know if you'd be interested in something like that.

573
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,270
你觉得怎么样
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

574
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,130
你怎么会...
How did you...

575
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,810
是啊  这个地方其实是个圈
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.

576
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,080
但不是真正的圈  更像是个恐怖怪圈
But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle.

577
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,520
这没道理
This doesn't make any sense.

578
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,110
是啊  这里就是不讲道理的
No, nothing makes sense here, man.

579
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:17,330
没道理就是这里的道理
The only thing that does make sense is that nothing makes sense.

580
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,850
这里有人跟宗师的冠军打过吗
Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster's champion?

581
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,910
道格打过
Doug has.

582
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,800
道格
Doug!

583
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,590
这就是命  道格已经死了
Our luck, Doug's dead.

584
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:27,100
对了  跟宗师的冠军打过的人都死掉了
That's right. Everyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perishes.

585
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,850
你呢  你是石头做的
What about you? You're made of rocks.

586
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,880
会死掉的石头  看啊  又掉一块
Perishable rock. There you go. Another one gone.

587
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,650
我只是小打小闹
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,

588
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,380
暖暖场之类的
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

589
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,710
等等  你不是要去跟他打吧
Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you?

590
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,750
没错
Yes, I am.

591
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,830
我要跟他打  打赢他  然后离开这鬼地方
Gonna fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place.

592
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,210
道格以前就这么说
That's exactly what Doug used to say.

593
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,090
回见  新道格
See you later, new Doug.

594
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,850
没人记得我吗
Does no one remember me?

595
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,670
没人学过我们的历史吗
Has no one been taught our history?

596
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,060
看看这些谎言
Look at these lies.

597
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,800
高脚杯  花园聚会
Goblets and garden parties?

598
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,780
和平协议
Peace treaties?

599
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:16,650
奥丁...
Odin...

600
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,530
为成果骄傲
Proud to have it,

601
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,720
却觉得手段可耻
ashamed of how he got it.

602
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,400
我们曾势不可挡
We were unstoppable.

603
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,130
在扩张阿斯加德帝国时  我曾是他的武器
I was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard's empire.

604
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:52,610
我们征服了一个又一个王国
One by one, the realms became ours.

605
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:57,210
然后  就因为我的野心比他更大
But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his,

606
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,680
他就将我放逐  囚禁
he banished me, caged me,

607
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,840
像只野兽一样把我锁了起来
locked me away like an animal.

608
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,160
在那之前  阿斯加德的战士是受尊敬的
Before that, Asgard's warriors were honored,

609
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,660
他们的遗体像英雄那样葬在这宫殿下面
their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace.

610
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,420
-奥丁的宝藏  -赝品
- Odin's treasures. - Fake.

611
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,140
这里大部分的东西都是赝品
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

612
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,040
或者没用
Or weak.

613
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,960
比我以为的要小
Smaller than I thought it would be.

614
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,740
这个还可以
That's not bad.

615
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,600
但是这个...
But this...

616
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,490
永恒烈火
The Eternal Flame.

617
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,210
想看看真正的力量是什么样子吗
Want to see what true power really looks like?

618
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,480
亲爱的芬里斯  他们对你做了什么
Fenris, my darling, what have they done to you?

619
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,440
永恒烈火将让你们重生
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

620
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,140
我好想你
I've missed you.

621
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:07,690
我想念你们大家
I've missed you all.

622
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,620
奥丁
Odin,

623
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,400
我愿你升入英灵殿
I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla,

624
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,680
勇者将在那里永生
where the brave shall live forever.

625
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,780
我们应该高兴而不是哀伤
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,

626
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:25,100
因为他们死得光荣
for those that have died the glorious death.

627
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,060
扎心  对吗
Hurts, doesn't it?

628
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:35,630
被欺骗的感觉
Being lied to.

629
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,170
告诉你是一回事  然后你发现那都是假的
Being told you're one thing and then learning it's all a fiction.

630
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,600
你不会以为我真的会来这里见你吧
You didn't think I'd really come and see you, did you?

631
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,190
这地方太恶心了
This place is disgusting.

632
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,350
你是不想要我帮忙吗
Does this mean you don't want my help?

633
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,650
我不能失去我在宗师身边的地位
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position with the Grandmaster.

634
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,140
我为赢得他的信任很费心力
It took me time to win his trust.

635
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,740
他是个疯子  但也是有办法应付的
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.

636
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,070
我是想告诉你
What I'm telling you is,

637
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,130
你可以跟我一起服侍宗师
you could join me at the Grandmaster's side.

638
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,900
也许将来  宗师会出事  然后...
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...

639
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,470
你不是真在考虑回去吧
You're not seriously thinking of going back, are you?

640
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,010
我们姐姐像砸玻璃一样轻松毁了你的锤子
Our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass.

641
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,670
她比我们都强  她比你强
She's stronger than both of us. She's stronger than you.

642
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:26,080
你一丝机会都没有
You don't stand a chance.

643
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,050
你明白我什么意思吗
Do you understand what I'm saying here?

644
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,740
好吧
Fine.

645
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,730
那我得单干了
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.

646
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,570
一如既往
Like I've always done.

647
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,220
你能不能说点什么
Would you say something?

648
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,160
说话啊
Say something!

649
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,230
你要我说什么
What would you like me to say?

650
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,220
你装死
You faked your own death,

651
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,210
偷了王位  剥夺了奥丁的法力
you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power,

652
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,780
把他留在地球上等死  放出了死亡女神
stranded him on Earth to die, releasing the Goddess of Death.

653
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,630
这些够不够
Have I said enough

654
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,580
还是你要我继续翻两天之前的旧账
or would you like me to go back further than the past two days?

655
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:10,860
我还没见过他口中这个宠儿冠军
You know, I haven't seen this beloved champion he talks of,

656
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,240
但听说他野蛮得吓人
but I've heard he is astonishingly savage.

657
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,080
明天的格斗  我下了很大的注压你输
I've placed a large wager against you tomorrow.

658
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,680
别让我失望
Don't let me down.

659
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,860
滚开  鬼
Piss off, ghost!

660
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,670
他消失了
He's freaking gone.

661
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,690
恶心
Yuck!

662
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,920
这上面还留着不知谁的毛发和血
There's still someone's hair and blood all over this.

663
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,910
伙计们  格斗完能不能清理下武器啊
Guys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight?

664
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,490
恶心的懒蛋
Disgusting slobs.

665
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:48,500
托尔  用大木叉子吗
Thor, wanna use a big wooden fork?

666
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,090
不了
No.

667
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:51,500
是啊  不太实用
Yeah, not really useful.

668
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,540
除非你要打挤成一团的
Unless you're fighting off three vampires

669
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,010
三个吸血鬼
that were huddled together.

670
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,580
真希望我的锤子还在
I really wish I had my hammer.

671
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:58,770
锤子
Hammer?

672
00:48:58,770 --> 00:48:59,550
很特别
Quite unique.

673
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:03,300
是用濒死星球内核的特别金属制成
It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star.

674
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,720
我快速抡它
And when I spun it really, really fast,

675
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,220
就能飞起来
it gave me the ability to fly.

676
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,370
你骑在锤子上
You rode a hammer?

677
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,170
不  不是骑在上面
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

678
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,380
它骑在你背上
The hammer rode you on your back?

679
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,650
不  我快速抡它
No. I used to spin it really fast,

680
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,230
它就会把我带起来...
and it would pull me off the...

681
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,460
天啊  锤子给你撸吗
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?

682
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,100
把我带离地面  它会带我离开地面
The ground. It would pull me off the ground,

683
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,120
带我升入空中  我就能飞了
up into the air, and I would fly.

684
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,460
我把它扔出去  它总能回到我手中
Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me.

685
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,810
你和这把锤子的关系好像很特殊
Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship

686
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:26,460
很亲密
with this hammer

687
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,800
失去它堪比失去爱人
and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.

688
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,730
这么说挺温馨的
That's a nice way of putting it.

689
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,620
我说了这些是我的
I said they're mine.

690
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:39,410
看  就是她把我抓来的
See her, that's the one that put me in here.

691
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,440
是啊  拾荒者142号
Yeah. Scrapper 142.

692
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,580
要小心这些阿斯加德人
Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man.

693
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,170
命硬得很
They are hard to perish.

694
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:46,670
阿斯加德人
Asgardian?

695
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,830
别用那玩意电我  我有话要说
Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk.

696
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,500
阿斯加德有危险了
Asgard is in danger.

697
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,450
天啊  你是女武神
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

698
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,610
我小时候还想当女武神
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger,

699
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:10,090
但之后我发现你们都是女的
until I found out that you were all women.

700
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,610
是女的没什么不好  我爱女人
There's nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women.

701
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,140
有时太爱了
Sometimes a little too much.

702
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,530
不是猥琐的那种  是尊重的欣赏
Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation.

703
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:21,840
能有一支女武士组成的精英部队真的很不错
I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors.

704
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,180
是时候了
It's about time.

705
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,200
-你说完没  -雷王  该你了
- Are you done? - Lord of Thunder, you're up.

706
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,800
求你  帮帮我  我需要你的帮助
Please, help me. I need your help.

707
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,490
再见
Bye.

708
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,770
好吧  那你不是叛徒就是懦夫
Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward.

709
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,010
因为女武神都发过誓要保卫王权
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne.

710
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,620
听仔细了  殿下  这是萨卡  不是阿斯加德
Listen closely, your majesty. This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

711
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,430
我是拾荒者  不是女武神
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

712
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,550
带他过来收拾一下
Bring him in for processing.

713
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,950
没人能逃出这里  所以你反正也是个死
And no one escapes this place. So you're gonna die anyway.

714
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,890
你别动
Now, don't you move.

715
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,990
我的手不如以前稳了
My hands ain't as steady as they used to be.

716
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,310
以奥丁的胡子起誓  你不准剪我的头发
By Odin's beard, you shall not cut my hair,

717
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:12,310
不然就会尝到托尔之怒的滋味
lest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor.

718
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,680
求你了  求你了  好心人  别剪我头发
Please. Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.

719
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,290
求你  不要
Please! No!

720
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,110
不
No!

721
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,330
看看你们  今晚比赛多么精彩
Look at all of you. What a show! What a night!

722
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,360
谁觉得开心
Who's having fun?

723
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,380
我是你们的主持人
Please, I'm your host.

724
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:46,750
请掌声感谢所有赛前战的格斗者
Big round of applause for all of our undercard competitors,

725
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,980
他们今天死得真可怕
who today died so gruesomely.

726
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,150
比赛真棒
Good sports.

727
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,150
今晚比赛多么精彩
What a show! What a night!

728
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,250
我们都是为格斗而来的
This is what you've come for, and so have I.

729
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,300
现在  不再耽搁
And now, without further ado,

730
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,260
压轴比赛开始了
it's main event time.

731
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:13,840
虽是首次登场  但却很有潜力
Making his first appearance, though he looks quite promising,

732
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,960
有点绝招
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.

733
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,670
我不再多说了  你们来自己判断
I'll say no more, see what you think.

734
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,800
女士们先生们  有请
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

735
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,200
雷王
Lord of Thunder.

736
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,260
小心他的手指  会放火花
Watch out for his fingers. They make sparks.

737
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,990
好了  来吧
Okay, this is it.

738
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:54,520
我们准备欢迎这家伙吧  他来咯
Let's get ready to welcome this guy. Here he comes.

739
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,350
他这个家伙
He is a creature.

740
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:06,120
我们要怎么说呢
What can we say about him?

741
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,760
他很特别  独一无二
Well, he's unique. There's none like him.

742
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,120
我觉得跟他有特别的感情
I feel a special connection with him.

743
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,530
他从未有败绩
He's undefeated.

744
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,940
是连胜者
He's the reigning.

745
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,010
是卫冕方
He's the defending.

746
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,450
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen...

747
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:24,650
有请
I give you...

748
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:33,640
无敌的
Your Incredible...

749
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:39,180
绿巨人
Hulk!

750
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,030
太好了
Yes!

751
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,340
我得离开这个星球
I have to get off this planet.

752
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,290
你想去哪啊
Where you going?

753
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,710
我俩认识
We know each other.

754
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,490
他是我战友
He's a friend from work.

755
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,400
你去哪了
Where have you been?

756
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,550
大家都以为你死了
Everybody thought you were dead.

757
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,960
我们上次一别后发生了好多事
But so much has happened since I last saw you.

758
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:19,990
我失去了锤子
I lost my hammer.

759
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:23,350
就昨天  还记忆犹新的
Like, yesterday, so that's still pretty fresh.

760
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,720
洛基还活着  相信吗
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?

761
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,020
他就在上面
He's up there.

762
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,230
洛基  看这是谁
Loki! Look who it is!

763
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,890
班纳  真没想到我会这么说
Banner, I never thought I would say this,

764
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:35,820
但我见到你可真高兴
but I'm happy to see you.

765
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,200
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

766
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,780
班纳
Banner.

767
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:47,780
班纳
Banner!

768
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,770
不是班纳  只有绿巨人
No Banner. Only Hulk.

769
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,790
你在干什么
What are you doing?

770
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,240
是我啊  托尔
It's me. It's Thor!

771
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,660
班纳  我们是朋友啊
Banner, we're friends.

772
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,570
这真是疯了  我不想伤你
This is crazy. I don't want to hurt you!

773
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,820
这就对了  这才像话
Here we go. Here we go.

774
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,400
什么
What?

775
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:58,320
大块头
Hey, big guy.

776
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,190
太阳快下山了
The sun's getting real low.

777
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,410
没错  太阳要下山了
That's it. The sun's going down.

778
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:20,270
我不会再伤害你了
I won't hurt you anymore.

779
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:22,030
没人会伤害你了
No one will.

780
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,490
没错
Yes!

781
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,270
就是这感觉
That's how it feels!

782
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,780
我就是太喜欢这项运动了
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

783
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,590
好吧  不管了
All right. Screw it.

784
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,900
我知道你还在的  班纳
I know you're in there, Banner.

785
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,100
我会把你逼出来的
I'll get you out!

786
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,150
你是怎么了  真让我下不来台
What's the matter with you? You're embarrassing me!

787
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:17,040
我还跟他们说我们是朋友
I told them we were friends!

788
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,540
雷哥  雷哥
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

789
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:57,660
雷哥  雷哥
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

790
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,190
又一天  又一个道格
Another day, another Doug.

791
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,710
那是什么声音
What is that noise?

792
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,060
民众并没有乖乖听话
The common folk aren't exactly falling in line.

793
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,530
有抵抗者想撞倒大门
There's a resistance trying to knock down the front gates.

794
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,080
说说你自己吧  斯科尔奇
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

795
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,970
我爸是个石匠  我妈是...
Well, me dad was a stonemason. Me mum was...

796
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:03,910
嗯  打住吧  我的意思是
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there. What I meant was,

797
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:05,350
你的野心是什么
what's your ambition?

798
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:10,140
我只想要个机会证明自己
I just want a chance to prove myself.

799
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,860
承认
Recognition.

800
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:13,820
我年轻时
When I was young,

801
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,120
每位伟大国王都有个处刑人
every great king had an executioner.

802
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,720
不仅仅是进行处刑
Not just to execute people,

803
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,000
也执行国王的愿景
but also to execute their vision.

804
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,320
但主要还是做处刑的
But mainly to execute people.

805
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,310
但  这仍是无上光荣
Still, it was a great honor.

806
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,640
我曾是奥丁的处刑人
I was Odin's executioner.

807
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:38,510
你就做我的处刑人
And you shall be my executioner.

808
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,700
我们开始征程吧
Let's begin our conquest.

809
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:58,970
斯科尔奇  剑呢
Skurge, where's the sword?

810
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,820
那把剑是打开彩虹桥的钥匙
That sword is the key to opening the Bifrost.

811
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,810
你提到的那些人
Those people you mentioned,

812
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,790
那些不肯乖乖就范的
the ones who aren't falling into line...

813
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:13,640
把他们都抓起来
Round them up.

814
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,600
借过
Excuse me.

815
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:54,230
抱歉了  那些玩意到处都是
Sorry about that. These bloody things are everywhere.

816
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:55,850
走吧
Come on.

817
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:32,400
你们在这里是安全的
You'll be safe here.

818
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:43,530
我们没事了吧
Are we cool?

819
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:48,730
绿巨人洗热浴盆
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

820
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,720
你这样多久了
So how long have you been like that?

821
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,430
什么样
Like what?

822
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,250
这样  大块头  绿色的  呆头呆脑
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.

823
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,340
绿巨人一直是绿巨人
Hulk always Hulk.

824
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,320
你怎么到这儿的
How'd you get here?

825
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,390
靠赢
Winning.

826
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:09,810
你是说作弊吧
You mean cheating?

827
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,310
你赢的时候  对手也都有这玩意吗
Were they wearing one of these when you won?

828
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,000
你怎么来到这儿的
How'd you arrive here?

829
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:17,960
昆式战斗机
Quinjet.

830
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,220
很好  那架昆式战斗机现在在哪
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

831
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,770
你没穿衣服
That's naked.

832
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:29,180
他没穿衣服
He's very naked.

833
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:35,300
这下忘不掉了
It's in my brain now.

834
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,460
昆式战斗机
Quinjet.

835

我要带咱们离开

837
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:53,290
这个糟糕的地方
This terrible, awful place.

838
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,990
你会喜欢阿斯加德的

839
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,640
很大  还金闪闪的
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

840
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,780
绿巨人不走
Hulk stay.

841
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:02,470
不不  我的人民需要我回阿斯加德
No, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard.

842
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,120
我们得阻止诸神黄昏
We must prevent Ragnarok.

843
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,420
诸神黄昏
Ragnarok?

844
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,330
我家园的毁灭预言
The prophesied death of my home world.

845
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:10,420
世界末日  一切终结
The end of days, it's the end of...

846
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:14,160
如果你帮我回阿斯加德
If you help me get back to Asgard,

847
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:16,150
我可以帮你回地球

848
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:17,630

地球爱绿巨人  他们爱死你了

850
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,810
你是复仇者联盟成员  我们的队友  朋友
You're one of the Avengers. One of the team, one of our friends.

851
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:24,670
朋友就该如此  彼此支持
This is what friends do. They support each other.

852
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,170
你是班纳的朋友
You're Banner's friend.

853
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:28,400
我才不是班纳的朋友  我更喜欢你
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.

854
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,440
班纳的朋友
Banner's friend.

855
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,800
我都不喜欢班纳
I don't even like Banner.

856
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,260
"我喜欢数字  科学什么的"
"I'm into numbers and science and stuff."

857
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:35,860
托尔走  绿巨人留下
Thor go. Hulk stay.

858
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:36,540
好吧
Fine.

859
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,480
留下吧
Stay here.

860
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,700
破地方  难看死了
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.

861
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:45,660
又是红  又是白  选个颜色吧  真荒唐
The red, the white. Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

862
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,500
砸扁你
Smash you.

863
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:49,910
你才没砸扁什么  那场角斗我赢了
You didn't smash anything. I won that fight.

864
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:52,330
-我砸扁了你  -好吧
- I smashed you. - Yeah, sure, sure.

865
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:54,190
-小手臂  -什么
- Baby arms. - What?

866
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,120
小个子
Baby.

867
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:57,000
白痴  你个幼稚鬼
Moron! You big child.

868
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,980
托尔走
Thor go!

869
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:59,330
我在走
I am going.

870
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:05,790
托尔再走
Thor go again.

871
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,350
托尔在家了
Thor home.

872
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:23,350
绿巨人训练

873
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,270
好啊  祝你开心

874
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:27,370
-好啊  大块头  -生气姑娘
- Hey, big guy. - Angry girl.

875
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:28,590
你都干什么呢
What have you been up to?

876
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:29,660
获胜
Winning.

877
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:43,220
海姆达尔  我知道你看得到我
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

878
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:47,370
我需要你帮我
I need you to help me.

879
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:50,250
帮我看到
Help me see.

880
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,640
我看得到你  但你在很远的地方
I see you, but you're far away.

881
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,000
这里怎么回事
What's going on here?

882
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,410
自己来看吧
Come see for yourself.

883
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:12,540
我在祖先建造的要塞里庇护大家
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold built by our ancestors.

884
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:15,930
但如果抵挡不住  我们只能靠彩虹桥逃跑
But if the garrison falls, our only escape is Bifrost.

885
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:17,890
你想要疏散整个阿斯加德
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?

886
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:22,800
如果留下我们都活不久
We won't last long if we stay.

887
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:26,320
她汲取阿斯加德的力量  每天都更强大
She draws her power from Asgard and grows stronger every day.

888
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,030
走吧
Come on.

889
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,970
海拉很贪婪
Hela is ravenous.

890
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:34,170
如果我放走了她
If I let her leave,

891
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:36,490
她会吞噬整个九大王国甚至宇宙
she'll consume Nine Realms and all the cosmos.

892
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,320
我们需要你
We need you.

893
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,690
我在想办法了  但我都不知道自己在哪
I'm working on it. But I don't even know where the hell I am.

894
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,420
你所在的星球周围都是传送门  穿过其中一个
You're on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go through one.

895
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,180
-哪个  -大的那个
- Which one? - The big one.

896
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:14,980
托尔难过
Thor sad.

897
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,030
闭嘴
Shut up.

898
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,020
托尔难过
Thor sad.

899
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,220
我不难过  你个白痴
I'm not sad, you idiot.

900
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,570
我在生气
I'm pissed off!

901
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:29,080
愤怒  我失去了父亲
Angry. I lost my father.

902
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,490
我失去了锤子
I lost my hammer.

903
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:35,580
-唧唧歪歪  像个孩子  -你都没认真听
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby. - You're not even listening.

904
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,570
别踢东西
Don't kick stuff.

905
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,070
你真不够朋友
You're being a really bad friend.

906
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:42,430
你才不够朋友
You bad friend!

907
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:43,400
-你知道我们怎么喊你吗  -不知道
- You know what we call you? - No.

908
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,690
我们喊你蠢复仇者
We call you the stupid Avenger.

909
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:47,700
你是小复仇者
You're tiny Avenger!

910
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:51,640
你疯了吗
What, are you crazy?

911
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,510
是啊
Yes.

912
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:55,660
知道吗  地球是恨你
You know what? Earth does hate you.

913
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:16,920
不要
No.

914
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,260
很抱歉我说了那些话
I'm sorry I said those things.

915
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,940
你不是蠢复仇者
You're not the stupid Avenger.

916
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:27,300
没人喊你蠢复仇者
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.

917
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:28,960
没事
It's okay.

918
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,490
你不能随便冲人仍盾牌
You just can't go around throwing shields at people.

919
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:32,160
差点杀了我
Could have killed me.

920
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,130
我知道  对不起  我总是好生气
I know. I'm sorry. I just get so angry all the time.

921
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:37,370
绿巨人总是很生气
Hulk always, always angry.

922
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,400
我知道  我们是一样的
I know. We're the same, you and I.

923
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:42,030
我们就是俩鲁莽的傻瓜
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.

924
01:09:42,030 --> 01:09:46,120
是啊  一样  绿巨人是火  托尔是水
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water.

925
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,800
我们都是火
We're kind of both like fire.

926
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,790
但绿巨人是真火
But Hulk like real fire.

927
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,330
绿巨人是烈火
Hulk like raging fire.

928
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,990
托尔是阴燃火
Thor like smoldering fire.

929
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:00,870
绿巨人  我需要你帮我个忙
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.

930
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,850
生气姑娘
Angry girl.

931
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,360
怎么了  你...
What's going on? What are you...

932
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:29,470
你就蠢到看不出
You're so thick-headed that you can't tell

933
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:31,390
人家远远躲到了宇宙尽头
when someone's hiding all the way across the universe

934
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:32,650
就是不想被打扰吗
and wants to be left alone?

935
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:35,520
-我们得谈谈  -不  你想跟我谈
- We need to talk. - No, you wanna talk to me.

936
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:37,130
我需要她留下
I need her to stay.

937
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:37,920
留下
Stay?

938
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:39,860
挡住
Block.

939
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:42,840
留下
Stay.

940
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,210
-拜托  -拜托
- Please. - Please.

941
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,010
好吧
All right.

942
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,140
这样吧
Here's the deal.

943
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:54,610
我听你说
I'll listen to you

944
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,380
喝光这个我就走
till this is empty.

945
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:01,050
阿斯加德有危险  人民在牺牲
Asgard is in danger and people are dying.

946
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:03,100
我们得回去  我需要你帮忙
We need to get back there. I need your help.

947
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:06,820
喝完了  再见
Finished. Bye.

948
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,700
奥丁死了
Odin is dead.

949
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:15,540
死亡女神海拉  入侵了阿斯加德
Hela, the Goddess of Death, has invaded Asgard.

950
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,630
如果海拉回来了  那阿斯加德无望了
If Hela's back, then Asgard's already lost.

951
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:20,190
我要阻止她
I'm going to stop her.

952
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:22,190
-一个人吗  -不
- Alone? - Nope.

953
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,830
我在组建一支队伍
I'm putting together a team.

954
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,700
我  你还有大块头
It's me, you, and the big guy.

955
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,440
不  不组队  绿巨人单干
No. No team. Only Hulk.

956
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,300
我和你
It's me and you.

957
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,510
我看是只有你
I think it's only you.

958
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:34,940
求你  听我说  女武神都是传奇
Please, listen. The Valkyrie are legend.

959
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,790
阿斯加德的精英武士  发誓保护王权
Elite warriors of Asgard sworn to defend the throne.

960
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:38,860
我不要再次
I'm not getting dragged

961
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,980
被卷入奥丁的家庭纠纷当中
into another one of Odin's family squabbles.

962
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,780
-这话什么意思  -你姐姐
- What's that supposed to mean? - Your sister.

963
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,870
她的力量来自阿斯加德  你也是
Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.

964
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:46,310
当奥丁无法控制她的力量
When it grew beyond Odin's control

965
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:47,830
她就屠杀了王宫里的每个人
she massacred everyone in the palace

966
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:49,330
企图夺取王位
and tried to seize the throne.

967
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:51,180
她企图逃离驱逐时
When she tried to escape her banishment

968
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:53,330
他派女武神去抵抗她
he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back.

969
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,580
我能生还只是因为
I only survived because...

970
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,110
我已经迎战过她一次了
Look, I already faced her once

971
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:01,850
那是我还相信王权的时候
back when I believed in the throne,

972
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,650
而我失去了一切
and it cost me everything.

973
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:05,380
这就是阿斯加德的问题
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

974
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:08,090
王权  秘密  金色的骗局
The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.

所以我拒绝了王位

979
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:18,560

But this isn't about the crown. This is about the people.

980
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,930

986

你没看到吧

988
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,670
那么...这下好多了
There... That's better.

989
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:40,700
随你吧
You know, go ahead.

990
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:45,200
留下  为那个疯子奴役他人
Stay here and enslave people for that lunatic.

991
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,020
继续喝酒  躲藏
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

992
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:47,990
但我
But me...

993
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:53,640
我会冲向我的麻烦  而不是逃避它们
I choose to run toward my problems and not away from them.

994
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:55,840
因为...
Because that's what...

995
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,600
因为  英雄都会这么做
Because that's what heroes do.

996
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:16,050
朋友留下

宗师  我可以...
Grandmaster, I can...

01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,100
你干吗把融化棍递给我
Why are you handing me the melt stick?

1091
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,290
他打断了我
He was interrupting.

1092
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:59,340
那又不是死罪
That's not a capital violation.

1093
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,820
我说到哪了
Where was I?

1094
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:03,480
我的宝贝冠军不见了
My precious champion has come up missing,

1095
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,630
这都是因为那个雷王
and it's all because of that Lord of Thunder.

1096
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,070
都怪他
It's all because of him.

1097
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:08,100
你哥哥
Your brother.

1098
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:11,540
不管你们怎么回事  是领养还是另有隐情
Whatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated, or you know.

1099
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:12,610
我相信有很多渊源
I'm sure there's a big history.

1100

他是你带来的参赛者
And your contender...

1101
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:15,360
亲爱的朋友
My dear friend,

1102
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,350
如果你能给我12小时
if you were to give me 12 hours,

1103
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:19,100
我可以把他俩都活着带回来
I could bring them both back to you. Alive.

1104
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,370
我两小时就能做到
I could do it in two.

1105
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:22,710
我一小时就能做到
I could do it in one.

1106
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:23,890
打住吧
Let's stop there.

1107
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:25,550
知道吗  我今早醒来时
You know what? I woke up this morning

1108
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:27,380
想的是公开处决
thinking about a public execution.

1109
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,850
但现在  我可以安于
But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little

1110
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:32,610
"谁能先抓到他"
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1111
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,050
所以  你们得抓紧了
So, you're on the clock.

1112
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:39,100
你做了什么
What have you done?

1113
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,610
我不听命于你  狗腿子
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1114
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:41,700
是洛基
It's Loki.

1115
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:44,020
你要听命于宗师
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.

1116
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:49,520
你为什么要帮我哥哥和那个绿傻瓜逃跑
Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?

1117
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,260
我不帮任何人
I don't help anyone.

1118
01:18:57,810 --> 01:18:59,080
你是个女武神
You're a Valkyrie.

1119
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,350
我以为女武神都惨死了
I thought the Valkyrie had all died gruesome deaths.

1120
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:08,890
接下来要说什么想好了
Choose your next words wisely.

1121
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:12,230
非常抱歉  那记忆一定很痛苦
I'm terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory.

1122
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,920
太阳快下山了  要下山了
The sun's going down. It's getting really low.

1123
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,490
太阳快下山了  要下山了
The sun's going down. It's getting real low.

1124
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:10,860
该死
Oh, shoot.

1125
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:14,100
-太阳快下山了  -你能不能别念叨了
- Sun's getting low. - Would you stop saying that?

1126
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,310
我就是需要你保持冷静
I just need you to stay calm.

1127
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,420
冷静  我在外星球上
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1128
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:19,270
反正就是个星球  星球你也是去过的
This is just a planet. You've been on a planet before.

1129
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:20,190
是啊  就一个
Yeah. One.

1130
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,210
现在你去过俩了  这是好事
Now you've been on two. That's a good thing.

1131
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:23,710
-这是新体验  -天呐
- It's a new experience. - Oh, my God.

1132
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:24,670
我的神经元
My neurons,

1133
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:27,770
已经在超过我大脑信息处理速度地运作了
they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information.

1134
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,310
这次的感觉完全不一样
The whole thing is totally different this time.

1135
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,410
以前  我一直觉得
In the past, I always felt

1136
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,930
我和绿巨人各有一只手把着方向盘
like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel.

1137
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:36,030
但这次  就好像他拿了车钥匙
But this time, it's like he had the keys to the car

1138
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:37,630
而我被锁在后备箱里
and I was locked in the trunk.

1139
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:39,450
你现在回来了  这才最重要
All right, well, you're back now. That's all that matters.

1140
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:40,470
不  不是的
No, it's not what matters.

1141
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:41,310
我就是想告诉你
What I'm trying to tell you,

1142
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:43,520
如果我再变成绿巨人
is that if I turn into the Hulk again,

1143
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,050
班纳可能就再也回不来了
Banner may never come back.

1144
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:48,690
而且我们还困在一颗一切都让我紧张的星球上
And we're stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out.

1145
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:51,480
我们没被困  我会想到办法回家的
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home.

1146
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:52,830
谢谢
Thank you.

1147
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,280
不是你家  我的家  阿斯加德
Not your home, though. Asgard. My home.

1148
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,010
什么
What?

1149
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,680
听着  我的人民身陷危险
Listen, my people are in great danger.

1150
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,100
你和我  我们得去击退一个非常厉害的人
You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being,

1151
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,480
碰巧她还是我姐姐
who also happens to be my sister.

1152
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,620
好吧  这太离谱了
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...

1153
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,330
我不想打你姐姐  这是家庭问题
I don't wanna fight your sister. That's a family issue.

1154
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,670
不  她是邪恶化身
No, she's an evil being.

1155
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,590
我不管她怎么样
I don't care what she is.

1156
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,180
我不要再打谁了  我受够了
I'm not fighting any more beings. I'm sick of it.

1157
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:14,480
-什么  -我刚跟你说了
- What? - I just told you.

1158
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,690
如果我再变成绿巨人  我会变不回来的
If I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again.

1159
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:18,610
你都不在乎
And you don't care.

1160
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:20,650
不不  我要组建一支队伍
No, no. I'm putting together the team.

1161
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:21,930
绿巨人是火
The Hulk is the fire.

1162
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:24,040
等等  你是在利用我得到绿巨人
Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk.

1163
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:24,770
-什么  -真过分
- What? - It's gross.

1164
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:25,540
什么  不是的
What? No!

1165
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,720
你才不在乎我呢  你不是我的朋友
You don't care about me. You're not my friend.

1166
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,950
才不是  我都不喜欢绿巨人  他就...
No! I don't even like the Hulk. He's all like...

1167
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,410
"砸扁  砸扁  砸扁"
"Smash, smash, smash."

1168
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:33,990
我更喜欢你
I prefer you.

1169
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:35,730
谢谢
Thanks.

1170
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:39,670
但老实说  在对抗邪恶化身这件事上
But if I'm being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings,

1171
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:41,160
他是很强大很有帮助
he is very powerful and useful.

1172
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,300
班纳也很强大很有帮助
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.

1173
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:43,950
是吗
Is he though?

1174
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:46,510
好吧  绿巨人有几个博士学位  零
Okay. How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.

1175
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,660
班纳有多少个博士学位  七个
How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.

1176
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,590
好吧  你不用打任何人
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.

1177
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:53,520
但我们在这里有危险  我们得走了
But we're in danger here, so we have to move.

1178
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:58,350
你拿那个做什么
What are you doing with that?

1179
01:21:58,350 --> 01:21:59,910
我需要伪装  我是逃犯
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.

1180
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:02,170
-我也需要伪装  -你就是伪装
- I need a disguise. - You are the disguise.

1181
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:03,980
-我装成托尼·斯塔克  -什么
- I'll be Tony Stark. - What?

1182
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:06,220
嗯  托尼和吉普赛人
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1183
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:08,740
不  你不是托尼  你是布鲁斯·班纳
No, no, you're not Tony. You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1184
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,170
那你为什么把我打扮成托尼
Then why did you dress me up like Tony?

1185
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:11,420
因为你光着呢
Because you were naked.

1186
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,840
好吧  这是个好理由
Okay, I'll give you that.

1187
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:14,590
你干什么呢  别乱抓了
What are you doing? Stop doing that!

1188
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:16,090
托尼的裤子好紧
Tony wears his pants super tight.

1189
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:17,330
-别抓了  -抱歉
- Stop it! - I'm sorry.

1190
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:19,630
-你为什么怪怪的  -我不知道
- Why are you being so weird? - I don't know.

1191
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:22,250
或许我在一个怪物体内
Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years

1192
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:25,390
困了两年所以才怪怪的
inside of a monster made me a little weird.

1193
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:26,790
没事的
It's okay.

1194
01:22:26,930 --> 01:22:29,310
你没事的  冷静下来  走吧
You're good. Calm down. Calm down. Come on.

1195
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:30,980
我们去阿斯加德
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard

1196
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:33,220
你再也不用去想绿巨人了
and you're not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again.

1197
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:34,390
-好吗  -好
- All right? - All right.

1198
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,620
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

1199
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:43,570
这可太糟了
This is bad.

1200
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:49,650
班纳  班纳
Banner! Banner!

1201
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:54,060
班纳
Banner!

1202
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,030
班纳
Banner!

1203
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:10,780
托尔
Thor!

1204
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,670
我正打算那么做呢
I was gonna do that.

1205
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:27,170
我先做了
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1206
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:29,800
很好  你在这儿干什么
That's good. What are you doing here?

1207
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,670
你在这儿干什么  你不是要走吗
What are you doing here? I thought you were leaving.

1208
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:33,300
出了点小岔子
I got sidetracked.

1209
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:34,820
这是怎么...
What's with the...

1210
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:36,120
是我的伪装
It's my disguise.

1211
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,530
但我能看到你的脸
But I can see your face.

1212
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,410
我这样你不就看不到了
Not when I do this, you can't.

1213
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,070
你发型不错
Your hair looks nice.

1214
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:43,970
我喜欢你的处理  换过吗  还是洗了
I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?

1215
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:50,850
她眼睛上那个是什么
What are those things on her eyes?

1216
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:52,230
是她杀过的人吗
Are those people that she's killed?

1217
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:54,040
她好美  强壮又勇敢
She's so beautiful and strong and courageous.

1218
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,130
这家伙是谁
Who is this guy?

1219
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,130
-我吗  -我朋友
- Who? Me? - He's a friend.

1220
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:57,580
-我是布鲁斯  -我觉得我认识你
- I'm Bruce. - I feel like I know you.

1221
01:23:58,230 --> 01:23:59,640
我也这么觉得
I feel like I know you, too.

1222
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:08,400
听着  我多年来浑浑噩噩  想忘记过去
Look, I've spent years in a haze, trying to forget my past.

1223
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:10,750
萨卡似乎是借酒消愁  忘记过去
Sakaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget,

1224
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,150
混吃等死的绝佳之处
and to die one day.

1225
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:14,310
我是觉得你喝得太多了
I was thinking that you drink too much,

1226
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:15,630
可能会因此没命
and that probably was gonna kill you.

1227
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:17,290
我没打算停止喝酒
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1228
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:19,330
但我不想忘记
But I don't wanna forget.

1229
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,460
我不能再扭头不管了
I can't turn away anymore,

1230
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:23,370
所以  如果我要死
so if I'm gonna die, well,

1231
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,320
那不如是为了把我的剑
it may as well be driving my sword

1232
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,140
插进那个屠夫婆娘的心脏
through the heart of that murderous hag.

1233
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,520
-很好  -嗯
- Good. - Yeah.

1234
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:31,690
所以  我是说  我想加入你的团队
So, I'm saying that I wanna be on the team.

1235
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:33,290
有名字了吗
Has it got a name?

1236
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,760
嗯  叫报仇者联盟
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

1237
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:37,660
报仇者
Revengers?

1238
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:40,990
因为我要报仇  你也要报仇
Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge.

1239
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:43,800
还有你  你想报仇吗
You, too. What do you... Do you want revenge?

1240
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:46,610
-我还没决定  -好
- I'm undecided. - Okay.

1241
01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:49,410
另外  我还带了示和礼物
Also, I've got a peace offering.

1242
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,700
惊不惊喜
Surprise.

1243
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:02,500
得确认一下
Just had to be sure.

1244
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:07,730
你好  布鲁斯
Hello, Bruce.

1245
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:12,840
上次我见你时  你想杀了所有人
So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody.

1246
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,090
你现在都在忙什么
Where are you at these days?

1247
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:16,180
每时每刻都不一样
It varies from moment to moment.

1248
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,620
那是龙牙剑吗
Is that a Dragonfang?

1249
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,630
是的
It is.

1250
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,500
天啊
My God.

1251
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:24,160
这就是著名的女武神之剑
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.

1252
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,890
萨卡和阿斯加德
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about

1253
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:27,800
之间离得不能更远了
as far apart as any two known systems.

1254
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,440
最好的办法  是走城外的一个虫洞
Our best bet is a wormhole just outside of city limits.

1255
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:34,380
在山达尔补充燃料  18个月后就能回到阿斯加德了
Refuel on Xandar, and we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.

1256
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,450
不行  我们要走大的那个
Nope. We are going through the big one.

1257
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:39,220
魔鬼屁眼
The Devil's Anus?

1258
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:40,200
屁眼
Anus?

1259
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:41,500
等等  谁的屁眼
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1260
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,770
声明一下  我选的时候不知道它叫这么个名字
For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it.

1261
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:46,080
看起来像是在爱因斯坦罗森桥[虫洞]内
That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of

1262
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,020
坍缩的中子星
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1263
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:50,890
我们需要另找艘船  它会把我的船撕成碎片
We need another ship. That will tear mine to pieces.

1264
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:52,280
她说得对  我们需要一艘能禁得住
She's right. We need one that can withstand

1265
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,250
奇点短程线拉力的船
the geodetic strain from the singularity.

1266
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,180
还得有脱机动力转向系统
And has an offline power steering system

1267
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:58,620
没有机载电脑也能运行
that could also function without the on board computer.

1268
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,120
还得有杯托
And we need one with cup holders,

1269
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,340
因为我们要死了  喝酒吧
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!

1270
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:04,380
我认识你吗  我好像认识你
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.

1271
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:06,260
我也觉得我认识你  好奇怪
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.

1272
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,170
你觉得怎么样
What do you say?

1273
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:10,220
穿过不稳定的宇宙传送门进行未知总星系旅行
Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway.

1274
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:11,590
这才叫冒险
Talk about an adventure.

1275
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:13,640
-我们需要一艘飞船  -没错
- We need a ship. - Need a ship.

1276
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,250
有那么一两艘飞船  绝对是最顶尖的
There are one or two ships. Absolute top of the line models...

1277
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,750
你们不非得听我的
I don't mean to impose...

1278
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:23,090
但宗师有很多飞船
But the Grandmaster has a great many ships.

1279
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,730
我可能还偷到了他安全系统的密码
I may even have stolen the access codes to his security system.

1280
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:29,240
还突然难以抑制地想行正义之举吗
And suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing.

1281
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,310
天啊  不是
Heavens, no.

1282
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:31,940
宗师对我的好感已消磨殆尽
I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster,

1283
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:34,030
我用飞船和密码
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship,

1284
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:37,450
换安全穿过屁眼
I'm asking for safe passage through the Anus.

1285
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:40,790
你是说  你能让我们进入机库
You're telling us that you can get us access into the garage

1286
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:42,600
而不触发警报
without setting off any alarms?

1287
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,950
对  哥哥  我可以
Yes, brother. I can.

1288
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:47,170
好  我先...提醒你们一下
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.

1289
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:49,250
我几分钟前跟他说话的时候
I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago

1290
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:51,580
他很想杀了我们
and he was totally ready to kill any of us.

1291
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:52,520
他确实想杀我来着
He did try to kill me.

1292
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:54,650
是啊  我也是  好多次呢
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.

1293
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:56,330
我们小时候  有一次
There was one time when we were children,

1294
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,230
他变成了一条蛇
he transformed himself into a snake,

1295
01:26:58,230 --> 01:26:59,580
他知道我喜欢蛇
and he knows that I love snakes.

1296
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,470
我捡起蛇  好好欣赏
So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it,

1297
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:03,080
结果他变了回去
and he transformed back into himself

1298
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,280
大喊  "嘿  是我"
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"

1299
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,460
然后捅了我  我们当时才八岁
And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.

1300
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,010
我们要偷飞船的话
If we're boosting a ship

1301
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:11,010
得把王宫的守卫引开
we're gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.

1302
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:12,970
放出野兽吧
Why not set the beast loose?

1303
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:13,710
闭嘴
Shut up.

1304
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:14,940
你们有野兽
You guys have a beast?

1305
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:17,410
没有  没什么野兽  他在胡说
No, there's no beast. He's just being stupid.

1306
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,130
我们要挑起革命
We're going to start a revolution.

1307
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:21,020
-革命  -我过会儿再解释
- Revolution? - I'll explain later.

1308
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:23,420
-他是谁来着 -过会儿再解释
- Who's this guy again? - I'll explain later.

1309
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:26,980
你拉出来的
Is that some sort of protoplasm,

1310
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:29,590
是原生质吗  还是卵
all the stuff that's coming out of you, or are they eggs?

1311
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:31,820
看起来像卵
Looks like eggs.

1312
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,840
我找寇格
I'm looking for Korg.

1313
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:43,820
谁找我
Who's asking?

1314
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:45,310
我知道是你
I know you're asking.

1315
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:48,040
还有别人吗  还是只有你
Is there anyone else asking, or is it just you?

1316
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:50,260
雷王向你问好
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.

1317
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:55,470
革命开始了
The revolution has begun.

1318
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:57,990
革命  怎么会这样
Revolution? How did this happen?

1319
01:27:58,090 --> 01:27:58,850
不知道
Don't know.

1320
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:02,180
但角斗场的服从圆盘主机
But the arena's mainframe for the Obedience Disks

1321
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,420
被关掉了
have been deactivated

1322
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:05,540
奴隶都武装起来了
and the slaves have armed themselves.

1323
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,050
我不喜欢那个词
I don't like that word.

1324
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:08,530
哪个  主机吗
Which? Mainframe?

1325
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:11,040
不是  我怎么会不喜欢"主机"
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?

1326
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,320
S开头的那个
No, the "S" word.

1327
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:16,460
抱歉  在职囚犯们都武装起来了
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves.

1328
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:19,120
这样好多了
Okay, that's better. That's better.

1329
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:26,970
听着  我们应该谈谈
So, listen. We should talk.

1330
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:29,380
我不同意
I disagree.

1331
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:32,580
我们家从来就不擅长开诚布公
Open communication was never our family's forte.

1332
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:34,070
可不是呢
You have no idea.

1333
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:36,780
我们上次谈过后发现的真相很是了不得
Been quite the revelation since we last spoke.

1334
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:38,050
你们好
Hello.

1335
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,520
奥丁让我们聚在一起
Odin brought us together.

1336
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:52,040
他的死让我们分裂  还挺诗意
It's almost poetic that his death should split us apart.

1337
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:00,000
我们现在与陌生人无异
We might as well be strangers now.

1338
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:03,720
两位王子  各自漂泊
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.

1339
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:08,360
你不是不想谈吗
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.

1340
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:11,060
问题是...
Here's the thing.

1341
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,940
我可能留在萨卡更好
I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.

1342
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:14,580
我也这么想
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1343
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:18,080
你刚刚是在同意我说的话吗
Did you just agree with me?

1344
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,850
这地方太适合你了
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

1345
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:21,750
野蛮  混乱  无法无天
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

1346
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,110
弟弟  你会在这儿如鱼得水的
Brother, you're gonna do great here.

1347
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,690
你就真这么瞧不起我
Do you truly think so little of me?

1348
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:29,410
洛基  我曾非常看重你
Loki, I thought the world of you.

1349
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:32,410
我以为我们能永远并肩战斗
I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever.

1350
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:35,970
但最终  你是你  我是我
But at the end of the day, you're you and I'm me.

1351
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:38,880
我也说不好  或许你还有一丝良心  但
I don't know, maybe there's still good in you, but...

1352
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:42,510
说实话  我们早已分道扬镳
let's be honest, our paths diverged a long time ago.

1353
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:48,140
是啊
Yeah.

1354
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:52,000
或许我们还是再也不要见面了比较好
It's probably for the best that we never see each other again.

1355
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:53,460
这不是你一直想要的吗
It's what you always wanted.

1356
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:58,920
我们来演"喊救命"吧
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1357
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,020
-什么  -"喊救命"
- What? - "Get Help."

1358
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:01,700
不
No.

1359
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:02,770
-来嘛  你最喜欢了  -我非常讨厌
- Come on, you love it. - I hate it.

1360
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:04,640
-这招多棒啊  每次都好使  -太丢人了
- It's great. It works every time. - It's humiliating.

1361
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,880
-你有更好的计划吗  -没有
- Do you have a better plan? - No.

1362
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:06,760
那就这么办
We're doing it.

1363
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:09,240
我才不要演"喊救命"
We are not doing "Get Help."

1364
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:11,780
救命  求你们了
Get help! Please!

1365
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:12,970
我弟弟快死了
My brother, he's dying.

1366
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,840
救命  帮帮他吧
Get help! Help him!

1367
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:17,960
经典
Classic.

1368
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:19,400
我还是讨厌
Still hate it.

1369
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:21,580
-太丢人了  -我又不丢人
- It's humiliating. - Not for me, it's not.

1370
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:24,190
好了  她让我们上哪艘船来着
Now, which one's the ship she told us to get?

1371
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:25,620
司令号
The Commodore.

1372
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:26,960
好的
Right.

1373
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:32,050
不过我觉得应该也没什么用
Though I feel it won't make much of a difference.

1374
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,470
洛基
Loki.

1375
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:39,240
我知道我背叛过你很多次
I know I've betrayed you many times before,

1376
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,090
但这次真不是针对你
but this time it's truly nothing personal.

1377
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:44,240
抓到你的赏金会让我过得很阔绰
The reward for your capture will set me up nicely.

1378
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,830
你果然从不是个重感情的人
Never one for sentiment, were you?

1379
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:47,460
无情会过得更轻松些
Easier to let it burn.

1380
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:48,890
我同意
I agree.

1381
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:58,750
看起来好痛
That looks painful.

1382
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,650
亲爱的弟弟  你越来越好猜了
Dear brother, you're becoming predictable.

1383
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:04,570
我信任你  你背叛我
I trust you, you betray me.

1384
01:31:04,570 --> 01:31:06,850
一遍又一遍
Round and round in circles we go.

1385
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:09,330
洛基  人生  是要成长的
See, Loki, life is about... It's about growth.

1386
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,280
是要改变的
It's about change.

1387
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:13,740
但你好像只想保持原样
But you seem to just wanna stay the same.

1388
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:15,700
我想说的是
I guess what I'm trying to say

1389
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:18,800
你永远都只是恶作剧之神
is that you'll always be the God of Mischief,

1390
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:20,810
但你本可不止如此
but you could be more.

1391
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,020
我就把这个留给你了
I'll just put this over here for you.

1392
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:29,020
好了  我们都还有地方要去  所以祝你好运了
Anyway, all got places to be, so good luck, I guess.

1393
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,500
好了  你能搞定的
All right, you can figure this out.

1394
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:38,080
不过是又一艘宇宙飞船罢了
It's just another spaceship.

1395
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,930
忠诚的萨卡人
Loyal Sakaarians,

1396
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:56,760
雷王偷了我的飞船和我最爱的冠军
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion.

1397
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:01,300
萨卡人  升空  把他打下来
Sakaarians, take to the skies. Bring him down.

1398
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:03,180
不要让他离开这个星球
Do not let him leave this planet.

1399
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:17,830
-打得不错  -谢谢
- Good shot! - Thanks.

1400
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:21,320
开门
Open the doors.

1401
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,260
好
Okay.

1402
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:30,030
我希望你比看起来要坚强一些
I hope that you're tougher than you look.

1403
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:31,000
为什么
Why?

1404
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,630
我们不该反击什么的吗
Shouldn't we be shooting back or something?

1405
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:46,620
是应该
Yes, we should.

1406
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:48,740
这船上的武器在哪里
Where are the guns on this ship?

1407
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:50,220
没有武器
There aren't any.

1408
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:52,090
-这是艘消遣船  -什么
- It's a leisure vessel. - What?

1409
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:55,370
宗师用它来享乐的  群交派对之类的
Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.

1410
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,980
她刚刚是说宗师用这船办群交派对吗
Did she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies?

1411
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:58,790
是的
Yeah.

1412
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:00,440
什么都别碰
Don't touch anything.

1413
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:21,960
不  不
No! No!

1414
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:26,730
-不  -不
- No! - No!

1415
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:34,630
进来
Get inside!

1416
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,080
马上
In a minute.

1417
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:49,240
我该去帮帮她  你过来开
I should probably go and help. Here, take the wheel.

1418
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:51,040
不行  我不会开这个
No. I don't know how to fly one of these.

1419
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,860
你是个科学家  用你的博士学位去搞明白
You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.

1420
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:56,690
那些学位都不是外星飞船驾驶啊
None of them are for flying alien spaceships!

1421
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:31,950
好吧  拜托
Okay, come on.

1422
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,640
这上面肯定有枪的
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.

1423
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:35,280
那看起来好像是枪
That looks like a gun.

1424
01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:39,680
今天我生日  今天我生日
It's my birthday. It's my birthday.

1425
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:42,150
今天我生日
It's my birthday.

1426
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:50,210
好啊
Yeah!

1427
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:09,970
伙计们  我们马上就要进入恶魔屁眼了
Guys, we're coming up on the Devil's Anus!

1428
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:17,880
在那儿
There she is.

1429
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,360
我们逃离的途径
Our ticket out of here.

1430
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:21,620
这是什么
Hey, what's this?

1431
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:27,430
谢谢
Thank you.

1432
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:30,430
老兄  我们要跳上那艘超大飞船离开这里
Hey, man. We're about to jump on that ginormous spaceship.

1433
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:31,250
要一起来吗
You wanna come?

1434
01:35:31,950 --> 01:35:36,130
你们看起来确实急需一位领袖
You do seem like you're in desperate need of leadership.

1435
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:37,240
谢谢
Why, thank you.

1436
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,700
来了
Here we go.

1437
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:50,310
该死
Shit.

1438
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:09,400
阿斯加德人民
Asgardians...

1439
01:36:09,670 --> 01:36:12,220
有不知好歹的人
Some misguided soul

1440
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,980
偷走了彩虹桥之剑
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1441
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,140
告诉我们它在哪里
Tell us where it is

1442
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:20,200
否则后果自负
or there will be consequences.

1443
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:25,660
严重的后果
Bad ones.

1444
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:29,330
有人说吗
Well?

1445
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:37,670
你
You.

1446
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,480
不  住手
No! Stop!

1447
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:45,780
求你们
Please.

1448
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:17,750
动手啊  处刑人
Well? Executioner?

1449
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:23,870
等等
Wait!

1450
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,250
等等
Wait!

1451
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:29,070
我知道剑在哪
I know where the sword is.

1452
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,550
没想到我还能再回来
I never thought I'd be back here.

1453
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:19,210
我以为会更美一些呢
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

1454
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:22,920
倒不是说它不美  只是着火了
I mean, not that it's not nice. It's just, it's on fire.

1455
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:24,370
看  山上
Here, up here in the mountains.

1456
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:26,700
有热信号  那里聚集了很多人
Heat signatures. People clustered together.

1457
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:27,800
她要去找他们了
She's coming for them.

1458
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:30,150
好  把我丢在王宫  我去引开她
Okay, drop me off at the palace and I'll draw her away.

1459
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:31,340
你想害死自己吗
And get yourself killed?

1460
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:32,980
困在那里的人才是最重要的
The people trapped down there are all that matters.

1461
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:34,210
我去应付海拉时
While I'm dealing with Hela,

1462
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:36,190
你们得疏散阿斯加德的人民
I need you two to help get everyone off Asgard.

1463
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:37,940
我们要怎么做啊
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

1464
01:38:38,470 --> 01:38:39,960
我在地面上有人接应
I have a man on the ground.

1465
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:47,180
阿斯加德人民
Asgard.

1466
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:51,240
她来了
She's here.

1467
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:04,940
这下飞船有火力了
Now the ship has a gun.

1468
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,340
交给我吧
I'll take it from here.

1469
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:10,030
我在武器库发现了这个
I found this in the armory.

1470
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:14,330
祝你好运
Good luck.

1471
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,170
陛下
Your Majesty...

1472
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:20,450
别死了
Don't die.

1473
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,490
你懂我意思的
You know what I mean.

1474
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:25,530
别停步
We must keep moving!

1475
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,230
去彩虹桥
Go to the Bifrost!

1476
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:11,950
姐姐
Sister.

1477
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:16,030
你还活着
You're still alive.

1478
01:41:16,430 --> 01:41:19,920
我喜欢你对这里的改造  重装修了啊
I love what you've done with the place. Redecorating, I see.

1479
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,200
看来我们父亲解决
It seems our father's solution

1480
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:25,320
所有问题的思路都是掩盖
to every problem was to cover it up.

1481
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:27,750
或驱逐
Or to cast it out.

1482
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:33,620
他对你说你有资格  他也对我说过这话
He told you you were worthy. He said the same thing to me.

1483
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:35,530
你瞧
You see?

1484
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:37,980
你根本不了解他
You never knew him.

1485
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:40,260
没见过他最辉煌的时刻
Not at his best.

1486
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:45,580
奥丁和我曾让整个文明淹死在血泪之中
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears.

1487
01:41:45,690 --> 01:41:47,990
你以为这些金子是哪来的
Where do you think all this gold came from?

1488
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:50,630
然后  有一天
And then, one day,

1489
01:41:50,630 --> 01:41:53,250
他突然决定做个仁慈的君王
he decided to become a benevolent king.

1490
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:56,100
制造和平  保护生命
To foster peace, to protect life.

1491
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:58,920
生下你
To have you.

1492
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:01,560
我能理解你的愤怒
I understand why you're angry.

1493
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:02,710
你毕竟是我姐姐
And you are my sister,

1494
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:05,450
严格讲  有权继承王位
and technically have a claim to the throne.

1495
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:08,100
相信我  我也愿意别人来统治
And believe me, I would love for someone else to rule.

1496
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:09,260
但那不能是你
But it can't be you.

1497
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:12,970
你真是坏透了
You're just the worst.

1498
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:15,970
好吧  起来
Okay, get up.

1499
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:18,220
你坐在我的位置上了
You're in my seat.

1500
01:42:19,610 --> 01:42:21,260
父亲曾对我说
You know, Father once told me

1501
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,390
一位明君从不挑起战争
that a wise king never seeks out war.

1502
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:27,300
但必须时刻做好准备
But must always be ready for it.

1503
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,000
回去
Go back!

1504
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:06,490
回去
Go!

1505
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:44,280
老实说  我以为你有更大本事呢
To be honest, I expected more.

1506
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,540
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

1507
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:52,810
剑
The sword!

1508
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,180
我们的不同之处在于
Here's the difference between us.

1509
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:00,720
我是奥丁的长女
I'm Odin's firstborn,

1510
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:03,670
合法继承人  阿斯加德的拯救者
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.

1511
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:05,230
你什么都不是
And you're nothing.

1512
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,680
如此简单  瞎子都看得清
So simple, even a blind man could see it.

1513
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:24,210
这下你让我想起了爸爸
Now you remind me of Dad.

1514
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,820
那只臭狗打不死
The stupid dog won't die!

1515
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:01,070
没事了  交给我吧
Everything's gonna be all right now. I got this.

1516
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:02,900
你想知道我是谁
You wanted to know who I am?

1517
01:45:04,410 --> 01:45:06,100
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

1518
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:07,610
你会看到的
You'll see!

1519
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,820
瞧  谁都别想跑
You see? No one's going anywhere.

1520
01:45:58,820 --> 01:45:59,980
我会拿到那把剑
I'll get that sword,

1521
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:02,350
哪怕我为此要杀光他们每个人
even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it.

1522
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:30,630
伙计
Hey, man.

1523
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:33,660
我是寇格  这是米克
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1524
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:35,680
我们要跳上那艘飞船离开这里
We're gonna jump on that spaceship and get out of here.

1525
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:36,590
要一起来吗
Wanna come?

1526
01:46:45,670 --> 01:46:49,760
你们的拯救者到了
Your savior is here.

1527
01:46:57,170 --> 01:46:58,090
想我了吗
Did you miss me?

1528
01:46:58,810 --> 01:47:00,770
大家快上船吧
Everyone, on that ship now.

1529
01:47:05,050 --> 01:47:07,350
欢迎回家  我看到你来了
Welcome home. I saw you coming.

1530
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:08,130
当然了
Of course you did.

1531
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,770
虽然是英勇之举  但你们毫无胜算
It's a valiant effort, but you never stood a chance.

1532
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:29,180
瞧
You see...

1533
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:33,130
我不是女王  或怪物
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1534
01:47:34,930 --> 01:47:36,660
我是死亡女神
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1535
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:40,010
你是什么的神来着
What were you the god of, again?

1536
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:53,490
就算是你有两只眼睛时
Even when you had two eyes,

1537
01:47:54,150 --> 01:47:55,830
也只能看清一半
you'd see only half the picture.

1538
01:47:57,470 --> 01:48:00,560
她太强大了  没有锤子  我做不到
She's too strong. Without my hammer, I can't.

1539
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:03,920
你是托尔  锤子之神吗
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?

1540
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:11,810
锤子是用来帮你控制力量  集中力量的
That hammer was to help you control your power, to focus it.

1541
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:14,390
不是你力量的源泉
It was never your source of strength.

1542
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:17,680
太迟了  她已经夺下了阿斯加德
It's too late. She's already taken Asgard.

1543
01:48:18,530 --> 01:48:20,940
阿斯加德不是一个地方  从来不是
Asgard is not a place. Never was.

1544
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:23,810
这里就可以是阿斯加德
This could be Asgard.

1545
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:27,110
阿斯加德是我们人民的所在
Asgard is where our people stand.

1546
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:32,820
而现在  那些人民需要你的帮助
Even now, right now, those people need your help.

1547
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:41,910
我不像你那么强大
I'm not as strong as you.

1548
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:46,000
是啊
No...

1549
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:48,650
你比我更强大
You're stronger.

1550
01:48:58,140 --> 01:48:59,450
告诉我  弟弟
Tell me, brother.

1551
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:01,970
你是什么的神来着
What were you the god of, again?

1552
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:19,640
-你来迟了  -你缺了只眼睛
- You're late. - You're missing an eye.

1553
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:20,840
还没打完呢
This isn't over.

1554
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:30,550
我觉得我们该解散报仇者
I think we should disband the Revengers.

1555
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:33,010
用闪电打她
Hit her with a lightning blast.

1556
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:33,900
我刚用史上
I just hit her with the

1557
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:35,780
最大的闪电打她了
biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning.

1558
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:36,860
毫无作用
It did nothing.

1559
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:43,130
我们得抵住她  直到大家都上了船
We just need to hold her off until everyone's on board.

1560
01:51:43,610 --> 01:51:44,840
那也不是个完
It won't end there.

1561
01:51:45,430 --> 01:51:48,780
海拉在阿斯加德待得越久  她就越强大
The longer Hela's on Asgard, the more powerful she grows.

1562
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:50,050
她会找到我们的
She'll hunt us down.

1563
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,560
我们得在此时此地阻止她
We need to stop her here and now.

1564
01:51:52,630 --> 01:51:53,780
我们怎么办
So what do we do?

1565
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:56,020
我不要再演"喊救命"了
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1566
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:10,620
阿斯加德不是一个地方  是人民所在
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.

1567
01:52:13,790 --> 01:52:14,570
洛基
Loki,

1568
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:16,760
我们根本不是要阻止诸神黄昏
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.

1569
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:19,100
我们要引发诸神黄昏
This was about causing Ragnarok.

1570
01:52:19,170 --> 01:52:20,940
苏尔特尔的王冠  在地堡里
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1571
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:23,190
只能如此
It's the only way.

1572
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:25,510
真大胆  哥哥
Bold move, brother.

1573
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:28,090
我都不敢想
Even for me.

1574
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:32,720
我们来吧
Shall we?

1575
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:35,110
你先请
After you.

1576
01:53:00,410 --> 01:53:01,600
这真是疯了
This is madness.

1577
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,250
走  快走
Go! Go, now!

1578
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:19,670
为了阿斯加德
For Asgard.

1579
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:35,310
海拉
Hela!

1580
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:03,710
永恒烈火将让你重生
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

1581
01:55:15,390 --> 01:55:16,970
海拉  够了
Hela, enough!

1582
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:23,220
你想要阿斯加德  它是你的了
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1583
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:26,850
不管你在玩什么把戏  不会成功的
Whatever game you're playing, it won't work.

1584
01:55:27,190 --> 01:55:28,910
你休想打败我
You can't defeat me.

1585
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:30,510
我知道
No, I know.

1586
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:33,490
但他能
But he can.

1587
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:38,680
不
No.

1588
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:50,670
在我脚下震颤吧  阿斯加德
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1589
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:53,490
我是你的末日
I am your reckoning!

1590
01:56:02,110 --> 01:56:03,380
人民安全了
The people are safe.

1591
01:56:04,410 --> 01:56:05,460
那才是最重要的
That's all that matters.

1592
01:56:07,990 --> 01:56:09,670
我们实现了预言
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

1593
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:11,230
我恨这则预言
I hate this prophecy.

1594
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:13,350
我也是  但我们没别的办法
So do I, but we have no choice.

1595
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:15,110
苏尔特尔毁掉阿斯加德
Surtur destroys Asgard,

1596
01:56:15,110 --> 01:56:17,690
才能毁掉海拉  我们的人民才能生还
he destroys Hela, so that our people may live.

1597
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:20,360
但我们得让他做完  否则
But we need to let him finish the job, otherwise...

1598
01:56:22,590 --> 01:56:23,460
不
No!

1599
01:56:25,850 --> 01:56:27,680
绿巨人  停下  你个白痴
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1600
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:38,100
绿巨人  停下
Hulk, stop.

1601
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:41,340
就这一次  别砸了
Just for once in your life, don't smash.

1602
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:43,370
大怪物
Big monster!

1603
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:45,310
我们走吧
Let's go!

1604
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:47,960
好吧
Fine.

1605
01:57:12,470 --> 01:57:15,430
我是阿斯加德的末日
I am Asgard's doom!

1606
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,230
毁得还不算太严重
The damage is not too bad.

1607
01:57:40,430 --> 01:57:42,640
只要地基还撑得住
As long as the foundations are still strong,

1608
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:44,420
我们还能重建
we can rebuild this place.

1609
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:48,320
它可以成为全宇宙人民
It will become a haven for all peoples

1610
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,110
和外星人的避难所
and aliens of the universe.

1611
01:57:56,890 --> 01:57:59,110
这下地基是没了  抱歉
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.

1612
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:15,550
我做了什么啊
What have I done?

1613
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:19,120
你让我们免遭灭绝
You saved us from extinction.

1614
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:21,920
阿斯加德不是一个地方
Asgard is not a place...

1615
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:24,360
是人民的所在
It's a people.

1616
01:58:54,110 --> 01:58:55,020
挺适合你
It suits you.

1617
01:58:58,470 --> 01:59:00,970
或许你也没那么坏  弟弟
Maybe you're not so bad after all, brother.

1618
01:59:01,550 --> 01:59:02,370
或许吧
Maybe not.

1619
01:59:03,790 --> 01:59:04,540
谢谢
Thank you.

1620
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:07,550
如果你真在这里  我或许还会抱抱你
If you were here, I might even give you a hug.

1621
01:59:12,330 --> 01:59:13,070
我在这儿
I'm here.

1622
01:59:38,050 --> 01:59:38,780
你的王位
Your throne.

1623
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:57,960
那么  阿斯加德国王
So, King of Asgard.

1624
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:08,840
我们去哪
Where to?

1625
02:00:10,330 --> 02:00:11,240
我不确定
I'm not sure.

1626
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:13,380
有什么提议吗
Any suggestions?

1627
02:00:16,170 --> 02:00:18,070
米克  你是哪来的
Miek, where are you from?

1628
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:19,450
米克死了
Miek's dead.

1629
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:23,240
是啊  我刚刚在桥上不小心踩到了他
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge.

1630
02:00:23,450 --> 02:00:26,700
我好愧疚  我抱了他一天了
I've just felt so guilty, I've been carrying him around all day.

1631
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:30,360
米克  你还活着
Miek, you're alive!

1632
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:32,940
他还活着  你刚问什么来着  哥们
He's alive, guys. What was your question again, bro?

1633
02:00:34,530 --> 02:00:35,560
去地球吧
Earth it is.

1634
02:02:52,450 --> 02:02:55,270
你真觉得回地球是个好主意吗
Do you really think it's a good idea to go back to Earth?

1635
02:02:55,510 --> 02:02:58,390
当然  地球人民喜欢我  我很受欢迎
Yes, of course. The people of Earth love me. I'm very popular.

1636
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:00,870
我换个说法
Let me rephrase that.

1637
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:04,860
你真觉得带我回地球是个好主意吗
Do you really think it's a good idea to bring me back to Earth?

1638
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:06,780
老实说  或许不是
Probably not, to be honest.

1639
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:08,670
别担心  弟弟
I wouldn't worry, brother.

1640
02:03:08,950 --> 02:03:11,050
我觉得一切都会没问题的
I feel like everything's gonna work out fine.

1641
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:42,090
天呐
Oh, boy.

1642
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:54,020
我想说  我为你们所有人骄傲
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.

1643
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:58,290
这场革命非常成功  大家好棒
This revolution has been a huge success. Yay, us!

1644
02:09:58,410 --> 02:10:01,080
鼓励鼓励自己  干得好
Pat on the back. Pat on the back.

1645
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:03,280
来嘛  不吗
Come on. No?

1646
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:05,870
我也是  因为我是其中重要的一部分
Me too. 'Cause I've been a big part of it.

1647
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:08,700
没有人去推翻  哪里来的革命呢
Can't have a revolution without somebody to overthrow.

1648
02:10:08,780 --> 02:10:10,630
所以  不客气
So, you're welcome.

1649
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,370
我们平手了
And it's a tie.
